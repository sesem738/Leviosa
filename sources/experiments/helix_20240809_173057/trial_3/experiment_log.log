2024-08-09 17:32:56,805 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for a drone to draw a helical path:

[REQ] Number of drones: 1
[REQ] Starting position:  The drone should begin at the origin (0, 0, 0) of the 3D space.
[REQ] Flight path: The drone will follow a helical path, characterized by:
    * **Shape:** A 3-dimensional helix with a constant radius and pitch.
    * **Direction:** The helix can be either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the desired orientation.
    * **Parameters:** The radius and pitch of the helix should be specified as input parameters, determining the size and tightness of the spiral.
[REQ] Movement: The drone should move at a constant speed along the helix.
[REQ] End condition: The drone should continue along the helix until a specified number of turns or a predetermined distance is reached.

 MAJORITY VALID (5/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The critics agree that the drone's trajectory is valid and meets all the requirements. 

**Common Points:**

* **Trajectory:** The drone follows a continuous, counterclockwise helical path with a constant radius and pitch, starting at the origin.
* **Continuity:** The drone's path is smooth and continuous.
* **Completeness:** The drone completes the specified number of turns of the helix.
* **Anomalies & Collisions:** No anomalies or collisions are observed.
* **Starting Position:** The drone starts at the origin (0, 0, 0).
* **Overall Shape:** The overall shape formed by the drone's trajectory matches the specified helix.

**Overall Consensus:** The critics unanimously agree that the drone's trajectory is valid and meets all the requirements.  

**Score:**  The provided feedback does not contain information about a previous score, making it impossible to compare the scores.
