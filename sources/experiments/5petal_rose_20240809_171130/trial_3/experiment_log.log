 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 5-Petal Rose Curve

This command requests a visually appealing drone formation mimicking a 5-petal rose.  The key is to ensure synchronized movements for a smooth, harmonious visual effect. 

Here are the structured requirements:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 5 
**[REQ] Starting formation:**  The drones should start in a pentagon formation, equally spaced with each drone at a vertex,  centered at the origin of the rose curve.
**[REQ] Flight path:** Each drone will follow a separate petal of the rose curve, moving in a synchronized manner.  
    * Each drone follows a parametric curve defined by:
        * x = a*cos(t)*sin(5*t)
        * y = a*sin(t)*sin(5*t)
    *  Each drone's "a" value will be the same, controlling the size of the rose. 
    * Each drone will have a unique phase offset (0, 2π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 8π/5) applied to its "t" value. This offset ensures the drones form distinct petals with synchronized movement.
**[REQ] Synchronization:**  The drones should move in a synchronized way, with each drone's position determined by a unique phase offset in the parametric equation. The movement should be smooth and continuous.
**[REQ] Visual effect:** The drones should create a visually appealing 5-petal rose shape as they move. 
**[REQ] Flight duration:** The drone movement should last long enough to clearly display the rose pattern. The duration can be adjusted based on the desired effect.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The provided feedback consistently points out that the current trajectories are incorrect and fail to meet the requirements.  

**Common Points of Criticism:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory:** The drones are not following the specified 5-petal rose curve.  They either follow a single petal, a single loop, or are all stationary.
* **Lack of Synchronization:** The drones are not moving in a synchronized manner with appropriate phase offsets, resulting in a lack of distinction between their individual trajectories.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:**  The drones do not start in the required pentagon formation. 
* **Lack of 3D Visualization:** The trajectories are displayed in 2D, failing to create the desired 3D rose shape.

**Overall Consensus:** 

All critics agree that the current trajectories do not meet the requirements. They lack the synchronized movement and 3D visualization needed to create a visually appealing 5-petal rose.

## Feedback Summary:

The feedback continues to highlight issues with the drone trajectories, although the provided plot is receiving a lower score than before. While the paths are generally continuous, the drones are failing to form the required 5-petal rose shape.  This is due to several factors:

**Common Points of Criticism:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory:** The drones are not following the specified 5-petal rose curve. They either follow a single petal, a single loop, or are all stationary.
* **Lack of Synchronization:** The drones are not moving in a synchronized manner with appropriate phase offsets, resulting in a lack of distinction between their individual trajectories.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones do not start in the required pentagon formation.
* **Incorrect Movement in 3D space:** Drones are moving in the z-dimension, which is not required.

**Overall Consensus:**

All critics agree that the current trajectories do not meet the requirements. The drones are not moving in a synchronized way and their trajectories do not form the desired 5-petal rose shape.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback continues to highlight issues with the drone trajectories, although the provided plot is receiving a lower score than before. While the paths are generally continuous, the drones are failing to form the required 5-petal rose shape.  This is due to several factors:

**Common Points of Criticism:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory:** The drones are not following the specified 5-petal rose curve. They either follow a single petal, a single loop, or are all stationary.
* **Lack of Synchronization:** The drones are not moving in a synchronized manner with appropriate phase offsets, resulting in a lack of distinction between their individual trajectories.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones do not start in the required pentagon formation.
* **Incorrect Movement in 3D space:** Drones are moving in the z-dimension, which is not required.

**Overall Consensus:**

All critics agree that the current trajectories do not meet the requirements. The drones are not moving in a synchronized way and their trajectories do not form the desired 5-petal rose shape.

**Previous Score:** 40/100

**Current Score:** 0/100

**Score Change:** -40

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback consistently points to significant issues with the drone trajectories, even showing a decline in score compared to the previous iteration. 

**Common Points of Criticism:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory:** The drones are still failing to follow the specified 5-petal rose curve. 
* **Lack of Synchronization:** The drones lack the necessary phase offsets, leading to a single trajectory instead of distinct petals.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones are not positioned correctly at the vertices of a pentagon.
* **Incorrect Movement:** There's a persistent issue with the drones moving in the z-dimension, which is not required.

**Overall Consensus:**

All critics agree that the current implementation fails to meet the requirements. The lack of synchronized movement and the incorrect trajectory formation are the primary concerns.

**Previous Score:** 40/100

**Current Score:** 0/100

**Score Change:** -40
