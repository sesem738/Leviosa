 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements for a 4-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The command requests a synchronized flight pattern for four drones, each tracing a distinct petal of a four-petal rose curve. The requirement for smoothness and continuity implies the drones should maintain a consistent formation and flow seamlessly into one another's trajectories.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] **Number of drones:** 4
[REQ] **Starting formation:** The drones should start in a square formation, centered at the origin of the rose curve. Each drone should be positioned at a corner of the square, equidistant from the center. 
[REQ] **Flight path:** Each drone will trace one petal of the four-petal rose curve. The drones should fly in a synchronized manner, each following a slightly offset path to create a smooth, continuous curve. To achieve this:
    * The starting positions of the drones should be offset by 90 degrees (π/2 radians) from each other, relative to the center of the rose curve. 
    * The drone paths should be parameterized in terms of the angle θ, where θ ranges from 0 to 2π.
    * The equation for each drone's path can be derived from the polar equation of a four-petal rose curve: r = cos(2θ). 
    * The drones will move along their respective paths at a constant speed, maintaining a consistent spacing between them to ensure the curve is smooth and continuous. 
    * Each drone's path will be a segment of the rose curve, covering one-fourth of the total angle (0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 for drone 1, π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π for drone 2, π ≤ θ ≤ 3π/2 for drone 3, and 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 2π for drone 4). 
[REQ] **Coordination:** The drones must maintain a synchronized flight pattern to ensure a smooth and continuous rose curve. This can be achieved using a centralized control system or through communication between the drones to adjust their speeds and positions relative to each other.
[REQ] **Flight duration:** The flight duration should be long enough for each drone to complete its designated segment of the rose curve.
[REQ] **Flight altitude:** The drones should maintain a constant altitude during the flight. 
[REQ] **Safety:** The drones should maintain a safe distance from each other and from any potential obstacles.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback consistently points out the lack of complete trajectories for all four drones. While individual drone paths might be continuous, the overall shape formed by the combined trajectories doesn't match the requirements of a four-petal rose curve.  

**Key Issues:**

* **Incomplete Trajectories:** Only Drone 4's trajectory is provided, leaving the other three drones unaccounted for. This prevents the evaluation of the overall shape.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The starting position of Drone 4 might be correct, but the starting positions of the other drones are unknown, making it impossible to assess if they comply with the square formation requirement.
* **Lack of Synchronization:**  The absence of complete trajectories makes it impossible to assess the synchronization between drones, especially concerning speed and spacing. 

**Overall Consensus:**

The critics unanimously agree that the provided image is incomplete and doesn't meet the requirements. A complete trajectory plot showing all four drones is necessary for a proper assessment and scoring. 

**Previous Score:** 0/100
**Current Score:** 0/100
**Score Improvement/Decrease:** The score has **not changed**.

 MAJORITY INVALID (1/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback is mixed. While critics generally agree that the drones are following continuous paths and avoiding collisions, there are significant issues with the completeness of trajectories, starting positions, and overall shape formation. Some critics have observed that certain drones are not tracing their full designated petals, leading to an incomplete four-petal rose curve.

**Key Issues:**

* **Incomplete Trajectories:**  Drones are not completing their full designated segments of the rose curve, resulting in an incomplete shape. This is specifically pointed out for drones 1 and 3.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones are not positioned at the corners of a square, centered at the origin, with the required 90-degree offset. Some reviewers have pointed out that while the formation is close to a square, it's skewed and not centered correctly.
* **Lack of Synchronization:** While not all critics observed a lack of synchronization, some mentioned that the drones need to move more uniformly to create a smooth and continuous curve, ensuring the petals are aligned correctly.

**Overall Consensus:**

The critics agree that the trajectories need further improvement, specifically addressing the incomplete paths and starting positions. The overall shape does not resemble the desired four-petal rose curve. However, there is a positive consensus that the drones are moving continuously and are not colliding.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics remains that the drone trajectories are not yet valid for forming a four-petal rose curve. While there's progress in some areas, significant issues persist.

**Key Issues:**

* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** While the drones are now starting in a square formation, the exact positioning is still off. They are not positioned at the corners of a square equidistant from the center, as required. 
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** Some critics observe that while each drone completes a petal, they are not completing the *correct* petal segments assigned to them. The drones need to be synchronized to ensure they trace the correct parts of the rose curve.
* **Overall Shape:** Despite some improvements, the overall shape formed by the drones is not a four-petal rose curve. The shape is close, but the lack of precise starting positions and synchronized movement contributes to the incorrect final shape.

**Positive Points:**

* **Continuity:** All critics agree that the trajectories are now continuous and smooth, indicating progress in this area.
* **Collision Avoidance:** The drones are successfully avoiding collisions, a crucial safety aspect.

**Overall Consensus:**

While there is improvement, the drones are not yet fulfilling the requirements. The trajectory needs further correction, with a focus on accurate starting positions, proper petal segment assignment, and synchronized movement. 

**Previous Score:** 20/100
**Current Score:** 55/100
**Score Improvement/Decrease:** The score has **improved** by +35.

 MAJORITY INVALID (1/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that there has been some improvement, but the drone trajectories are still not valid for forming a four-petal rose curve. 

**Key Issues:**

* **Synchronization:** The drones are not flying in a synchronized manner, resulting in an incomplete and incorrect rose curve. 
* **Petal Segment Assignment:** Critics observe that some drones are not completing the *correct* petal segments assigned to them. This indicates a lack of proper synchronization and trajectory planning. 
* **Starting Positions:** While the drones are now starting in a square formation, there's still some inconsistency in their positioning. They are not positioned perfectly at the corners of a square equidistant from the center, as required. 

**Positive Points:**

* **Continuity:** All critics agree that the trajectories are now continuous and smooth, indicating progress in this area.
* **Collision Avoidance:** The drones are successfully avoiding collisions, which is a positive development.

**Overall Consensus:**

There has been improvement, particularly in the continuity and collision avoidance aspects. However, the lack of proper synchronization and the inaccurate starting positions are preventing the drones from forming the desired four-petal rose curve.  

**Previous Score:** 20/100
**Current Score:** 55/100
**Score Improvement/Decrease:** The score has **improved** by +35.
