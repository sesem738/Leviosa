 ## Requirements for Drone Trajectory: 4-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The command requests a 4-drone formation to create a continuous 4-petal rose curve, emphasizing smooth transitions between drone paths.

Here are the structured requirements:

[REQ] Number of drones: 4
[REQ] Starting formation:  The drones should start in a square formation, equidistant from the center of the desired rose curve. This arrangement ensures symmetrical petal formation.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will trace one petal of the rose curve. The trajectory should be a smooth curve, with each drone transitioning seamlessly to the next petal.  To achieve this, the drones should follow a parametric equation for a 4-petal rose curve, likely r = a * sin(4 * theta), where 'a' is a constant determining the size of the rose, and 'theta' varies over a specific range to define the petal. The drones should synchronize their movement to maintain continuous flow and avoid gaps.
[REQ] Speed: The drones should maintain a consistent speed to ensure the smooth formation of the rose curve. This might require adjusting the speed based on the curvature of the path.
[REQ] Altitude: All drones should maintain a constant altitude throughout the flight, creating a flat 2D rose curve. 
[REQ] Communication:  Drones need to communicate with each other to synchronize their movements, ensuring smooth transitions between petals and a continuous curve.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are **not valid** as they do not successfully form a 4-petal rose curve.  While the drones generally follow a rose-like shape, there are several key issues:

* **Incomplete Petals:**  Most drones do not complete a full petal, leading to gaps in the overall formation. 
* **Synchronization Issues:**  The drones are not synchronized, resulting in abrupt transitions between petals and uneven petal lengths.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The starting positions, though close to a square formation, are not perfectly equidistant from the center, contributing to the unevenness of the rose.
* **Potential for Collisions:**  While no collisions are observed, the proximity of the drones in some areas raises concerns about potential collisions due to the lack of synchronization.

**Overall, the feedback emphasizes the need for significant improvements in the trajectory equations, drone synchronization, and starting positions to achieve a complete and smooth 4-petal rose curve.**

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus among critics is that while the trajectories are closer to meeting the requirements, they still fall short of forming a complete 4-petal rose curve. While the individual drone paths are continuous and smooth, the overall shape suffers from several shortcomings:

* **Incomplete Rose:** The petals are not completely formed, with gaps between them where one drone's path ends and the next begins. 
* **Synchronization Problems:** The lack of synchronization between drones leads to uneven petal lengths and abrupt transitions between petals. 
* **Starting Position Issues:** While the drones start in a square formation, their positions are not perfectly equidistant from the center, contributing to the shape's imperfections. 
* **Potential Collisions:** While no collisions are observed, the close proximity of drones in certain areas highlights the risk of collisions due to the lack of synchronization.

**Overall, the feedback suggests that significant improvements are needed in the trajectory equations, drone synchronization, and starting positions to achieve a complete and symmetrical 4-petal rose curve.**

## Feedback Summary:

The overall consensus remains negative. While there are minor improvements in some areas, the drones still fail to form the required 4-petal rose curve. Critics highlight several persistent issues:

**Common Issues:**

* **Incorrect Overall Shape:** The drones still do not form the desired 4-petal rose curve. Some solutions result in circles, others in an 8-petal rose or 4-leaf clover.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones often do not start in a square formation as required, leading to asymmetry in the final shape. 
* **Lack of Synchronization:** The drones are not moving in a synchronized manner, leading to gaps, inconsistencies, and sharp corners in the overall shape.
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** The drones are not completing the full trajectory required for each petal of the rose curve, often only completing a single loop.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Implement Correct Parametric Equation:** Ensure the drones are following the correct parametric equation for a 4-petal rose curve.
* **Synchronize Drone Movements:**  Synchronize the drones and ensure they move at consistent speeds.
* **Adjust starting positions:**  Ensure the drones start in a square formation equidistant from the center of the desired rose curve.
* **Complete the Trajectory:**  The drones should complete the full trajectory, returning to their starting positions after tracing each petal.
