 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 4-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The user desires a drone formation to create a continuous, smooth rose curve with four petals. Each drone will be responsible for tracing one petal, requiring coordinated movement.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 4
[REQ] Starting formation:  The four drones should begin in a square formation, centered on the origin of the desired rose curve. This ensures symmetrical petal formation.
[REQ] Flight path:
    * Each drone will trace a single petal of the rose curve.
    * The drones should maintain a constant distance from each other throughout the trajectory.
    * The path of each drone should be parameterized using a rose curve equation:
        * r = a * sin(n * theta)
        * Where 'a' is a constant defining the size of the petal, and 'n' is the number of petals (in this case, 4).
    * The drones should be synchronized in their movement, ensuring smooth transitions between petals.  
    * The starting and ending positions of each drone's trajectory should be aligned to ensure a continuous curve. 

[REQ] Coordination: 
    * The drones should maintain constant communication to ensure smooth transitions and avoid collisions.
    * The movement of each drone should be synchronized to ensure a seamless rose curve.

**Additional Considerations:**

* This trajectory requires careful calibration of the 'a' constant in the rose curve equation to ensure the desired size and shape of the petals. 
* For a visually appealing outcome, the drones should maintain a uniform speed throughout the trajectory.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback indicates that the current attempt at the drone formation is **WORSE** than the previous attempt. The previous score was **60/100**, while the current score is **20/100**, a decrease of **-40**. 

Here's a breakdown of the common points and consensus:

**Common Issues:**

* **Synchronization:**  The drones are not synchronized in their movements, resulting in a fragmented, discontinuous rose curve.
* **Overall Shape:**  The combined trajectories do not form a continuous, smooth 4-petal rose curve.
* **Starting Positions:**  The drones either start at the origin or in a square formation, but their starting positions are not always aligned with the intended petals.

**Areas of Improvement:**

* **Synchronization:**  The drones must be synchronized in their movement to create a smooth transition between petals. 
* **Parameterization:**  A more refined parameterization of the rose curve equation is required to ensure the correct size and shape of the petals, and to maintain a constant distance between the drones.
* **Starting Positions:** The drones should be placed at the corners of a square centered at the origin, ensuring a symmetrical and accurate formation.

**Overall, the feedback highlights the need for a more thorough understanding of the rose curve equation, synchronization of drone movements, and precise placement of the starting positions.**

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback indicates that the current attempt at the drone formation is **WORSE** than the previous attempt. The previous score was **50/100**, while the current score is **20/100**, a decrease of **-30**. 

Here's a breakdown of the common points and consensus:

**Common Issues:**

* **Continuity:**  The drones do not form a continuous, closed-loop 4-petal rose curve. Each drone traces a petal, but they are not connected. 
* **Overall Shape:** The combined trajectories do not form a 4-petal rose curve.
* **Starting Positions:** The drones start in a square formation, but it's not always centered on the origin.

**Areas of Improvement:**

* **Synchronization:** The drones must be synchronized in their movements to create a smooth transition between petals. 
* **Parameterization:**  A more refined parameterization of the rose curve equation is required to ensure the correct size and shape of the petals, and to maintain a constant distance between the drones.
* **Starting Positions:** The drones should be placed at the corners of a square centered at the origin, ensuring a symmetrical and accurate formation.
* **Continuity:** The trajectories need to be extended so that each drone completes a full petal, seamlessly connecting to the next. 

**Overall, the feedback highlights the need for a more thorough understanding of the rose curve equation, synchronization of drone movements, and precise placement of the starting positions.**
