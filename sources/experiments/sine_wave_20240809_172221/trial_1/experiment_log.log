 ## Structured Requirements for Sine Wave Drone Formation:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 3

**[REQ] Starting formation:**  The drones should start in a horizontal line formation, evenly spaced, positioned at the beginning of their respective sine wave segments. 

**[REQ] Flight path:** 
* Each drone will follow a sinusoidal path, with the amplitude and frequency of the sine wave being the same for all drones.
* The drones should be synchronized such that their horizontal positions are offset by 1/3 of the wavelength, creating a continuous wave shape.
* The drones should maintain their relative positions within the wave formation throughout the flight.
* The drone paths should be continuous and smooth, avoiding abrupt changes in direction.
* The drones should maintain a constant altitude throughout the flight.

**[REQ]  Constraints:** 
* The drones' flight path should be in the X-Y plane, assuming the Z-axis is the vertical direction.
* The sine wave's amplitude and frequency can be adjusted based on the desired visual effect.
* The starting point of the sine wave can be specified by the user.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are **NOT VALID**.  While the individual drone paths are continuous and smooth, they fail to meet the key requirement of forming a synchronized, continuous wave formation. 

Here's a breakdown of the common issues:

* **Synchronization:**  The drones are not flying in a synchronized manner, resulting in a series of parallel sine waves instead of a single, continuous wave. Critics emphasize the need for a 1/3 wavelength offset between drones to achieve the desired wave shape.
* **Spacing:** While the drones may start at the correct horizontal positions, they are not consistently spaced, leading to an uneven wave formation.
* **Starting Positions:**  Some critics note that the drones do not start in a horizontal line formation, further hindering the creation of a proper wave pattern. 

**Overall Shape:** The lack of synchronization and proper spacing results in an overall shape that does not resemble the required continuous wave formation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Synchronization:**  Adjust the drone trajectories to ensure they are synchronized with a 1/3 wavelength offset. 
* **Spacing:** Ensure the drones are evenly spaced in a horizontal line formation.
* **Starting Positions:**  Correct the starting positions of the drones to be in a horizontal line formation.

The consensus among critics remains that the drone trajectories are **NOT VALID**. While individual drone paths are generally continuous and smooth, the key issue remains the lack of a synchronized, continuous wave formation.

Here's a breakdown of common issues:

* **Synchronization:** The drones are not properly synchronized, resulting in a series of parallel sine waves rather than a single, continuous wave. The required 1/3 wavelength offset between drones is not consistently achieved. 
* **Trajectory Completeness:** Several critics note that drone trajectories seem incomplete, failing to form full sine waves.
* **Overall Shape:** The overall shape formed by the combined trajectories does not resemble the required continuous wave formation. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Synchronization:** Critics continue to stress the need to adjust drone trajectories to achieve proper synchronization with the 1/3 wavelength offset.
* **Completeness:** Ensure that each drone completes at least one full sine wave cycle.
* **Spacing:**  Ensure consistent spacing between drones to maintain a smooth wave formation.

* **Trajectory Completeness:**  The drones do not complete the full sine wave path, resulting in an incomplete formation.
* **Overall Shape:**  The overall shape formed by the drones does not match the requirement of a continuous wave.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The critics largely agree that the drone trajectories are still **NOT VALID**, despite some improvements.  They consistently point out the following issues:

* **Synchronization:** The drones remain unsynchronized, failing to form a continuous wave shape with a consistent 1/3 wavelength offset. This is a major issue for most critics.
* **Trajectory Completeness:** The drones often do not complete the full sine wave path, resulting in an incomplete formation. This is a major issue for some critics and a minor issue for others.
* **Overall Shape:**  The overall shape formed by the drones still does not match the requirement of a continuous wave. This is a major issue for most critics.
* **Potential Collisions:**  Some critics highlight the risk of collisions between some drones, especially if their movement is not adjusted. This is a minor issue for most.

## Score Comparison:

The **previous score** was **50/100**. The **current score** is **20/100**. 

Therefore, the score has **decreased** by **-30**, making the current performance **WORSE** than the previous attempt.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The critics are in agreement that the drone trajectories still fall short of meeting the requirements, despite some improvements.  The key issues consistently raised are:

* **Synchronization:** The drones remain unsynchronized, failing to create a continuous wave shape with the required 1/3 wavelength offset. This is a significant issue.
* **Trajectory Completeness:** Many critics point out that the drones fail to complete a full sine wave cycle, leading to an incomplete formation. 
* **Overall Shape:** The overall shape created by the drone trajectories does not accurately match the requirement of a continuous wave.

## Score Comparison:

The **previous score** was **50/100**. The **current score** is **20/100**. 

Therefore, the score has **decreased** by **-30**, making the current performance **WORSE** than the previous attempt.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The critics are in unanimous agreement that the provided trajectory plot is still inadequate. They consistently highlight the following issues:

* **Missing Trajectories:** The most significant issue is the lack of trajectories for Drones 1 and 2.  The plot only shows Drone 3's trajectory, making it impossible to assess the formation and overall shape.
* **Incorrect Shape:** Even Drone 3's trajectory does not accurately follow a sine wave pattern, failing to meet the specified requirement. 
* **Synchronization:**  Without the trajectories of Drones 1 and 2, it's impossible to evaluate if the drones are properly synchronized to create the required wave shape. 

## Score Comparison:

The **previous score** was **0/100**. The **current score** is **10/100**. 

Therefore, the score has **improved** by **+10**, making the current performance **BETTER** than the previous attempt.
