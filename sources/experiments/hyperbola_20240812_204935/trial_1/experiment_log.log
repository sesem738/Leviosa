 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Hyperbolic Path

Here are the structured requirements based on the provided command:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 2

**[REQ] Starting formation:** The drones should start at the two focal points of the intended hyperbola. This ensures they are equidistant from the center of the hyperbola, facilitating symmetrical paths.

**[REQ] Flight path:** 
* The drones will follow a hyperbolic path.
* Each drone will trace one branch of the hyperbola. 
* The paths should be symmetrical about the transverse axis of the hyperbola. This means that if one drone is at a specific point (x,y) on one branch, the other drone should be at (-x,y) on the other branch.
* The drones should maintain a smooth flight path along the hyperbolic curves. This may require the control system to adjust their speed and direction to ensure the path is continuous and does not exhibit abrupt changes.
* The exact shape of the hyperbola, including its orientation and dimensions, should be specified by the user or a pre-defined configuration. 

**[REQ] Additional considerations:**

* To ensure smoothness and symmetry, the control system should be aware of both drones' positions and continuously adjust their flight paths accordingly.
* Depending on the specific implementation, the control system may need to account for factors like air resistance and potential delays in communication to achieve a smooth and symmetrical flight path.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories are incorrect.  They fail to meet the most important requirement â€“ forming a hyperbolic shape. While the drones maintain continuous paths, they do not start at the focal points of the hyperbola and their paths do not follow a hyperbolic trajectory.  

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

* **Hyperbolic Path:** The drones are not following the intended hyperbolic path, resulting in a lack of the required overall shape. 
* **Starting Positions:** The drones do not start at the focal points of the hyperbola, which is crucial for the symmetry and formation of the intended shape. 
* **Drone 2's Trajectory:**  Often, Drone 2's path is not even attempting to form a hyperbolic shape. 

The overall scores for the trajectories range from 0 to 20 out of 100, with most critics giving a score of 0/100. 

**Previous Score:**  It seems the previous feedback did not include a numerical score. 

**Current Score:**  The average score based on the feedback provided is 10/100.

**Score Change:** We cannot determine if the score has improved or worsened because there is no previous score to compare it with.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The critics consistently agree that the provided trajectories do not meet the requirements for a hyperbolic path. 

**Common Issues:**

* **Incorrect Path:** The drones' paths are not hyperbolic. They either follow straight lines, curves, or a combination of both. 
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:**  The drones do not consistently start at the focal points of the intended hyperbola. 
* **No Symmetrical Formation:**  The drones do not form a symmetrical hyperbola, even when starting at roughly the correct positions.
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** The trajectories are often incomplete, failing to form a full hyperbolic shape.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Implement a Hyperbolic Path Generation Algorithm:** The control system should be programmed to generate accurate hyperbolic trajectories based on the specified hyperbola equation and desired shape.
* **Adjust Starting Positions:**  Ensure the drones begin at the focal points of the hyperbola.
* **Ensure Smooth and Symmetrical Flight:** The control system should continuously adjust the drones' speed and direction to maintain a smooth and symmetrical flight path along the hyperbola.

**Overall Consensus:** 

The provided trajectories are significantly flawed and require substantial revision. The control system needs a significant update to generate accurate hyperbolic paths and ensure the drones maintain a symmetrical formation. 

**Previous Score:** No previous score provided. 

**Current Score:** 10/100 

**Score Change:** We cannot determine if the score has improved or worsened because there is no previous score to compare it with.
