2024-08-12 20:51:09,001 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory based on the given prompt:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting positions: The two drones should start at the two focal points of the intended hyperbola. This ensures the most symmetrical path generation. 
[REQ] Flight path: 
    - Each drone will fly along one branch of a hyperbolic path. 
    - The two drones will maintain symmetrical paths with respect to the center of the hyperbola. 
    - The path should be smooth, meaning the drones should change direction gradually and avoid any abrupt turns or sharp angles. 
    - The specific parameters of the hyperbola (e.g., eccentricity, focal length) should be defined to ensure the desired scale and shape of the hyperbolic paths. 
[REQ] Formation:  While in flight, the drones will maintain a relative position that reflects the shape of the hyperbola. Their separation distance will dynamically adjust as they move along their paths. 
[REQ] Control System: The control system should be capable of generating and executing smooth, hyperbolic trajectories for the two drones, ensuring synchronized movement and symmetrical paths.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics consistently points out that the drones are not following hyperbolic paths as required, instead resembling parabolic paths.  While the drones are continuous and avoid collisions, the lack of correct path generation significantly impacts the score. 

Here's a summary of the common points:

* **Incorrect path:** The drones are not following a hyperbolic path, instead creating a parabolic shape.
* **Starting positions:**  The drones generally start at the correct focal points of the intended hyperbola.
* **Overall shape:** The overall shape formed by the drones does not resemble a hyperbola, failing to meet the requirements. 

**Overall Consensus:** The trajectories are largely incorrect due to the failure to generate hyperbolic paths. 

Based on the provided scores:

* **Previous Score:**  The provided feedback does not include a previous score, so it is impossible to determine this.
* **Current Score:** The lowest score given is **20/100**. 
* **Improvement/Decrease:**  Without the previous score, we cannot determine if the score has improved or decreased.

* **Relative Position:** The drones maintain a constant separation distance, not dynamically adjusting to the shape of the hyperbola.
* **Starting Positions:** Some critics suggest the starting positions are correct, while others note they are not positioned at the focal points of the hyperbola. 
* **Overall Shape:** The overall shape formed by the drones does not resemble a hyperbola, failing to meet the requirements. 
* **Collision:** There are potential collisions between the drones, indicating the need for improved collision avoidance systems.

**Overall Consensus:** The trajectories are largely incorrect due to the failure to generate hyperbolic paths. The critics emphasize the need for a control system that can calculate, generate, and execute smooth hyperbolic trajectories while maintaining the correct symmetrical positioning of the drones.

## Score Analysis:

* **Previous Score:**  The provided feedback does not include a previous score, so it is impossible to determine this.
* **Current Score:** The lowest score given is **0/100**. 
* **Improvement/Decrease:**  Without the previous score, we cannot determine if the score has improved or decreased.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback from the critics consistently highlights a failure to generate the required hyperbolic trajectories for the drones. While the drones maintain continuous paths and avoid collisions, the incorrect paths significantly impact the score. 

Here's a summary of the common points:

* **Incorrect Path:** All critics agree that the drones are not following hyperbolic paths, instead moving in straight lines or creating a parabolic shape. 
* **Symmetry:** The drone paths are not symmetrical, failing to reflect the mirrored nature of a hyperbola.
* **Completeness:** The trajectories are not complete, with some drones ending prematurely or not following the full hyperbolic path.
* **Relative Position:** The drones maintain a constant separation distance, not dynamically adjusting to the shape of the hyperbola.
* **Starting Positions:** Some critics suggest the starting positions are correct, while others note they are not positioned at the focal points of the hyperbola. 
* **Overall Shape:** The overall shape formed by the drones does not resemble a hyperbola, failing to meet the requirements. 
* **Collision:** There are potential collisions between the drones, indicating the need for improved collision avoidance systems.
