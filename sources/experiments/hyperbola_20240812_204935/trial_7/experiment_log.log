2024-08-12 20:58:34,223 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should start at the foci of the hyperbola. This ensures they are equidistant from the center of the hyperbola and will create a symmetric path.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will follow one branch of the hyperbola. The paths should be smooth and symmetrical.  
[REQ] Path shape: The path is a hyperbola.  
[REQ] Symmetry: The two branches of the hyperbola should be symmetrical with respect to the center. 
[REQ] Smoothness: The drones should move smoothly along the path, avoiding any abrupt changes in direction.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are **not valid** and **do not meet the requirements**. 

**Common Points:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:**  All critics agree that the drones are not following hyperbola paths. Instead, they are moving in straight lines.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:**  The starting positions of the drones are not at the foci of the hyperbola. 
* **Lack of Symmetry:**  The hyperbola branches formed by the drones are not symmetrical.
* **Overall Shape:** The combined trajectories of the drones do not form a recognizable hyperbola shape.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Implement Hyperbolic Paths:**  The drones need to be programmed to follow curved paths that resemble hyperbola branches.
* **Correct Starting Positions:**  The drones must start at the foci of the hyperbola, ensuring they are equidistant from the center and have the same Z-coordinate.
* **Ensure Symmetry:**  The two branches of the hyperbola need to be symmetrical with respect to the center.
* **Utilize Smooth Curves:**  Use a smooth curve function to ensure a smooth flight path for each drone.
* **3D Visualization:**  Consider using a 3D plotting library to better visualize the hyperbola and the drone trajectories.

## Score Comparison:

**Previous Score:**  Not provided in the context. 

**Current Score:**  The scores provided by the critics range from 0 to 20 out of 100. This indicates a significant lack of progress and a **WORSE** score compared to the previous iteration.

**Common Points:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:**  All critics agree that the drones are not following hyperbola paths. Instead, they are moving in straight lines.
