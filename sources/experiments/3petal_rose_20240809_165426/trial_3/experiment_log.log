2024-08-09 17:00:02,490 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 3
[REQ] Starting formation:  The drones should start at the three vertices of an equilateral triangle centered at the origin of the rose curve. This ensures a balanced and symmetric starting position for each drone to trace a petal.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will fly along a curve that forms one petal of a 3-petal rose. The drones must coordinate their movement so that the paths seamlessly connect, creating the full rose pattern. 
[REQ]  Coordinate system:  Assume a standard 2D Cartesian coordinate system (x, y) for defining the trajectory.
[REQ] Rose curve equation:  The equation for a 3-petal rose can be represented as: r = sin(3θ), where r is the radial distance from the origin and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. 
[REQ]  Synchronization:  The drones need to synchronize their movement, possibly by using a central control unit or a communication protocol, to ensure a seamless and synchronized trajectory.
[REQ]  Path smoothness:  The drones should move along a smooth, continuous path, avoiding abrupt changes in direction or speed. This is important to maintain the aesthetic appeal of the rose pattern and to ensure smooth flight.
