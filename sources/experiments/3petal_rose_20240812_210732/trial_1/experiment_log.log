 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 3-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The command requests a coordinated flight pattern for three drones, forming a 3-petal rose shape. Each drone is responsible for tracing one petal, implying that the drones must move in a synchronized manner.

**Structured Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 3
[REQ] Starting formation: The three drones should be positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, with the center of the triangle being the origin of the rose curve. This ensures a balanced and symmetrical starting configuration.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will trace a single petal of the rose curve. To achieve a seamless pattern, the drones must execute their petal trajectories in a synchronized manner, with a consistent speed and phase shift between them. The following parameters describe the flight path for each drone:
    * **Shape:** Each petal is a portion of a rose curve defined by the polar equation: r = a sin(3Î¸), where 'a' is a constant determining the size of the curve. 
    * **Phase Shift:** Each drone's flight path is a shifted version of the base rose curve, with a phase difference of 120 degrees between each drone. This will result in the three petals being evenly spaced and forming the desired 3-petal shape.
    * **Direction:** Each drone will traverse its respective petal in a counter-clockwise direction, starting from the vertex of the initial triangle.
[REQ]  Synchronization: The drones need to maintain synchronization throughout the flight, ensuring consistent speed and phasing for a smooth, seamless, and visually appealing 3-petal rose shape.
[REQ]  Flight duration:  The drones should complete one full revolution of the rose curve, resulting in each drone tracing one full petal.
[REQ]  Flight height: The drones should maintain a constant height throughout the flight. This height should be chosen based on safety and visual impact considerations.

**Note:** This specification assumes a purely geometric approach. For real-world implementation, factors like wind conditions, drone capabilities, and safety regulations should be carefully considered.
