 ## Requirements for Drone Circular Trajectory

**Interpretation:** This command describes a synchronized movement of two drones, each tracing a semi-circular path to form a complete circle.

Here are the structured requirements for the drone control system:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2

[REQ] Starting formation: The two drones should be positioned at opposite ends of a diameter of the desired circle.

[REQ] Flight path:
    * **Drone 1:**  Traces a semi-circular path, starting at its initial position and moving in a clockwise direction to meet Drone 2 at the opposite end of the diameter.
    * **Drone 2:**  Traces a semi-circular path, starting at its initial position and moving in a counter-clockwise direction to meet Drone 1 at the opposite end of the diameter.

[REQ] Synchronization: Both drones must maintain perfect synchronization throughout their flight, ensuring that they reach their respective endpoints at the same time.

[REQ] Circle properties: The circle formed by the combined paths of the two drones should be defined by a specific radius, which should be specified by the user.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The critics have mixed opinions about the drone trajectories. Here is a summary of the feedback:

**Common Points:**

* The trajectories are not completely accurate, with issues in starting positions and overall shape.
* The drones should trace semi-circular paths starting at opposite ends of a diameter, forming a complete circle.
* The starting positions are generally correct, but the orientation of the trajectories is incorrect.
* There are no visible anomalies or potential collisions.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the trajectories need significant improvement to meet the requirements. The starting positions of the drones should be corrected, and the trajectories should be adjusted to trace semi-circular paths, ensuring the overall shape forms a complete circle.

**Previous Score:** Based on the feedback, the previous score was around 50/100.

**Current Score:**  The current score is also around 50/100.

**Score Change:** The score has remained the same.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

**Common Points:**

* **Trajectory Continuity:** Most critics agree that the drones' paths are generally continuous, with no significant disruptions or collisions.
* **Trajectory Completeness:** The biggest issue identified is the incomplete nature of the semi-circular paths. While some critics see Drone 1's path as complete, others point out that it falls short of a full semi-circle.  Drone 2's path consistently struggles to complete its semi-circular trajectory, often ending prematurely or taking a straight line instead of a curve.
* **Starting Positions:** Critics highlight the importance of accurate starting positions. While the drones are generally placed at opposite ends of the diameter, precise placement is crucial for achieving a perfect circular formation.
* **Synchronization:** The synchronization of the drones' movements is a significant point of contention. Critics consistently find inconsistencies in the drones reaching their endpoints simultaneously, indicating a lack of proper synchronization.
* **Overall Shape:** The overall shape formed should resemble a complete circle, with the drones meeting at the opposite end of the diameter. However, most critics agree the current formation falls short of this requirement, due to the issues with the trajectories and synchronization.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the trajectories require substantial improvement. While the general concept of a circular formation is present, the incomplete paths, inaccurate starting positions, and lack of synchronization significantly hinder the execution.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

**Common Points:**

* **Trajectory Continuity:**  All critics agree that the drone paths are continuous, meaning there are no sudden jumps or breaks.
* **Trajectory Completeness:** The primary issue is the incomplete trajectories. Drone 1 typically falls short of completing its semicircle, while Drone 2 often deviates from the semicircular path, frequently ending prematurely or moving in a straight line.
* **Starting Positions:**  While generally placed at opposite ends of the diameter, some critics note inaccuracies in the starting positions, impacting the overall shape formation.
* **Synchronization:**  The lack of proper synchronization between the drones' movements is a recurring concern. Critics consistently point out that the drones fail to reach their endpoints at the same time, hindering the formation of a complete circle.
* **Overall Shape:** The most significant issue is the inability to form a complete circle. The incomplete trajectories and synchronization issues prevent the drones from achieving the desired circular shape.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the trajectories are significantly flawed. The inability to form a complete circle due to incomplete paths and poor synchronization is the primary concern. While there is progress in areas like continuity, the critical aspects of trajectory completeness and synchronization require substantial improvement.
