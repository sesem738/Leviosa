 ## Requirements for Drone Trajectory:

**[REQ] Number of drones: 2** 
*  The command specifies a "complete circle" formed by two drones, implying two are required.

**[REQ] Starting formation:**  
*  **Initial separation:** The drones should start at opposite ends of a diameter of the intended circle.
*  **Orientation:** Drones should be facing each other, ready to initiate their respective half-circle trajectories. 

**[REQ] Flight path:**
*  **Shape:** Each drone will follow a semi-circular trajectory, encompassing half of the circle's circumference.
*  **Direction:** Both drones will move in the same direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise), ensuring their trajectories combine to form a complete circle.
*  **Synchronization:**  The drones must maintain perfect synchronization throughout their flight. This means they must reach their corresponding points on the circle simultaneously, creating a visually complete circle at all times.
* **Final position:**  After completing their respective half-circles, the drones will end at their initial starting positions, forming the diameter of the circle again.

**[REQ] Additional Notes:**
* This is a trajectory generation task, so real-time constraints and obstacle avoidance are not considered. 
*  The specific radius and center point of the circle should be determined based on the operational context or further user input.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics highlights several recurring issues with the drone trajectories:

* **Incomplete Circle:**  The most common problem is that the drones do not form a complete circle. Either they are not synchronized, one drone doesn't complete its semi-circle, or they are moving in opposite directions.
* **Final Position:**  While some critics specifically mention this, there's a general consensus that the drones do not always return to their starting positions. 
* **Starting Position:** The drones sometimes don't start at the opposite ends of a diameter, facing each other, as required. 

**Overall Consensus:**

The critics agree that the trajectories are not valid and require significant improvement. The overall shape formed by the drones is consistently failing to meet the requirement of a complete circle.

**Previous Score:** Based on the provided feedback, the previous score was **65/100**. 

**Current Score:** The current score, considering all the feedback, is **40/100**.

**Score Change:** The score has **decreased** by **-25**.  This means the score is **WORSE**.

 Feedback Summary:
The feedback indicates a significant **worsening** of the drone trajectory performance.

**Previous Score:** 65/100 
**Current Score:** 40/100
**Score Change:** -25 (WORSE)

The critics consistently point out the failure to create a complete circle, with various issues contributing to this:

* **Synchronization:**  The drones frequently fail to move in unison, resulting in incomplete circles or distorted shapes. 
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** One or both drones may not complete their required semi-circular paths, leading to gaps in the intended circle. 
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones often fail to start at opposite ends of the diameter, facing each other, as required. This fundamental error significantly impacts the overall outcome.

While the starting position issue is often mentioned, the overall consensus is that the drones are consistently failing to form a complete circle. The previous score was likely inflated due to some individual critics overlooking these fundamental flaws.

 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics indicates a consistent failure to achieve the required complete circle formation using the drone trajectories.  While some aspects, like continuity and starting positions, are sometimes met, issues with synchronization and incomplete trajectories dominate the critiques.  The overall consensus is that the trajectories are not valid and require significant revision.

Here's a breakdown of the common issues:

* **Synchronization:** The drones often fail to move in unison, leading to incomplete circles or distorted shapes. 
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** One or both drones may not complete their required semi-circular paths, leading to gaps in the intended circle.

**Score Change:** -55 (WORSE) 

The score has significantly decreased, indicating a substantial drop in performance.  This suggests that the previous score was likely inflated as some critics may have overlooked the fundamental flaws in the trajectory formation.

Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that the trajectory plot still falls short of the requirements. While there is some improvement in certain aspects, the fundamental issues remain unresolved.  

Common Issues:

* **Synchronization:** While some critics note the drones are moving in the same direction, many still point out a lack of synchronization, with drones not reaching corresponding points simultaneously. 
* **Trajectory Completeness:** Though the plot is closer to forming a complete circle, some critics highlight the fact that the trajectories of the drones are not precisely semi-circular, causing deviations from the intended shape.
* **Starting Positions:**  There's continued disagreement about the accuracy of the starting positions. Some critics believe they are still not positioned at the opposite ends of a diameter, while others agree they are.

**Previous Score:** 65/100
**Current Score:** 50/100
**Score Change:** -15 (WORSE) 

The score has decreased, indicating that while some improvements were made, the overall performance hasn't reached the desired level. The plot still faces significant challenges in achieving the necessary synchronization and complete semi-circular trajectories.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The overall consensus is that the trajectories still need significant improvements to meet the requirements. While some critics see progress in certain areas, others believe the fundamental flaws remain unresolved.

**Common Issues:**

* **Completeness of Trajectories:** The most consistent criticism revolves around the trajectories not being complete. Although the drones might form a shape resembling a circle, the paths are not precisely semi-circular, preventing a truly complete and accurate circle formation.
* **Synchronization:**  There's a persistent concern regarding the synchronization of the drones. While they might be moving in the same direction, some critics note a lack of coordination, with drones not reaching their intended positions simultaneously.
* **Final Position:** A new issue has emerged: several critics highlight that drone 1 does not end at its starting position, as required. This impacts the overall shape and completion of the trajectory.

**Previous Score:** 65/100
**Current Score:** 40/100
**Score Change:** -25 (WORSE) 

The score has significantly decreased, indicating a decline in performance.  The plot still faces significant challenges in achieving the required synchronized, complete semi-circular trajectories, and accurate final positions.

Feedback Summary:

The overall consensus is that the trajectories still need significant improvements to meet the requirements. While some critics see progress in certain areas, others believe the fundamental flaws remain unresolved.

**Common Issues:**

* **Completeness of Trajectories:** The most consistent criticism revolves around the trajectories not being complete. Although the drones might form a shape resembling a circle, the paths are not precisely semi-circular, preventing a truly complete and accurate circle formation. 
* **Synchronization:**  There's a persistent concern regarding the synchronization of the drones. While they might be moving in the same direction, some critics note a lack of coordination, with drones not reaching their intended positions simultaneously.
* **Final Position:** A new issue has emerged: several critics highlight that drone 1 does not end at its starting position, as required. This impacts the overall shape and completion of the trajectory.
* **Starting Positions:** Many critics note that the drones are not starting at the correct positions or facing the correct directions.

**Previous Score:** 65/100
**Current Score:** 35/100
**Score Change:** -30 (WORSE) 

The score has significantly decreased, indicating a decline in performance.  The plot still faces significant challenges in achieving the required synchronized, complete semi-circular trajectories, and accurate starting and final positions.
