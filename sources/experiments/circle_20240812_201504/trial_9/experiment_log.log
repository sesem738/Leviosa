2024-08-12 20:41:53,794 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements based on the provided text prompt:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation: The two drones should be positioned at the opposite ends of a diameter of the intended circle.  This ensures they are initially 180 degrees apart.
[REQ] Flight path: 
    * Each drone should fly a semicircular path, with the two semicircles forming a complete circle.
    *  The drones should move in perfect synchronization. This means they must maintain a constant angular velocity and complete their semicircle paths simultaneously.
    * The direction of travel for each drone should be such that when combined, they form a clockwise or counterclockwise circle, depending on the desired direction of rotation. 
    *  The radius of the circle can be determined based on the provided context or specified by the user.

 MAJORITY INVALID (1/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics is mixed. There is a general agreement that the drones are positioned correctly and their paths are continuous and smooth. However, there is disagreement regarding the completeness of the trajectories and the overall shape formed by the drones.

**Common Points:**

* **Starting positions:** All critics agree that the drones are placed correctly at opposite ends of the diameter of the intended circle.
* **Continuity of paths:** All critics agree that the paths are continuous and smooth, with no sudden changes in direction.

**Points of Disagreement:**

* **Completeness of Trajectories:** Some critics argue that the drones do not complete their semicircular paths, while others find them valid. 
* **Overall Shape:** The biggest point of contention is the overall shape formed by the trajectories. Some critics see a nearly complete circle, others see a complete circle, while others see only a semicircle.

**Overall Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectories need further adjustments to form a complete circle with each drone completing its semicircular path simultaneously. 

**Score:**

* **Previous Score:** It appears the previous score was 80/100.
* **Current Score:** Based on the feedback provided, the current score is an average of 60/100 (60+60+75+100)/4 = 73.75/100. However, the lack of a single score makes it difficult to determine a precise average. 

**Score Change:**

Based on the average score, the score has **WORSE** by approximately 7 points.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics generally agree that the drones' paths are continuous and smooth. However, there's a significant disagreement on the overall shape formed by the trajectories and the completeness of the individual semicircular paths.

**Common Points:**

* **Starting Positions:** All critics agree the drones are correctly positioned at opposite ends of the intended circle's diameter.
* **Path Continuity:** The paths are consistently described as continuous and smooth.

**Points of Disagreement:**

* **Completeness of Trajectories:** The critics vary widely on whether the drones complete their semicircular paths, with some stating they are incomplete and others finding them sufficient.
* **Overall Shape:** There's no clear consensus on the overall shape formed by the trajectories. Some see a near-complete circle, others a complete circle, and others just semicircles.

**Overall Consensus:**

There's a general agreement that the trajectories need further adjustments to achieve a complete circle.  The drones should fly in perfect synchronization, completing their semicircular paths simultaneously.  

**Score:**

* **Previous Score:** 80/100.
* **Current Score:**  The scores are very inconsistent. A rough average would be 40/100.

**Score Change:**

Based on the average score, the score is **WORSE** by approximately 40 points.
