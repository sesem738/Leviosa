 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 3-Petal Rose Curve

The command requests a visually appealing 3-petal rose curve, implying a coordinated flight pattern requiring multiple drones. 

Here are the structured requirements:

**[REQ] Number of drones: 3**  - Necessary to create each petal of the rose.

**[REQ] Starting formation:**  Equilateral triangle, with each drone positioned at one vertex. This ensures optimal spacing for smooth petal formation.

**[REQ] Flight path:** Each drone will trace out a single petal of the rose. The overall path is defined by a 3-petal rose curve, which can be represented mathematically by the polar equation r = a * sin(3Î¸) for a constant value 'a'.

**[REQ] Trajectory Details:** 

* **Petal formation:** The drones should fly along the curve defined by the polar equation, with each drone covering a 120-degree arc (1/3 of the full 360-degree curve).
* **Synchronization:** The drones must synchronize their movement to ensure that the petals are traced out simultaneously and seamlessly.
* **Spacing:** The drones should maintain a consistent distance from each other throughout the flight to create a well-defined rose pattern.

**[REQ] Visual effect:** The drones should fly at a constant altitude, maintaining a visually appealing formation and creating a seamless 3-petal rose curve in the air.

**[REQ] Additional Requirements:**

* **Navigation system:** A reliable GPS system and waypoint navigation system is needed to ensure the drones follow the prescribed trajectory.
* **Communication system:** A robust communication system is required to synchronize the drone movements and maintain their relative positions.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories are significantly flawed and do not meet the specified requirements. 

**Common Issues:**

* **Incomplete Trajectories:**  Drones do not fully trace the required 3-petal rose curve, particularly drone 3, which often only covers a portion of the petal.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones are not positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, resulting in an incorrect starting formation.
* **Lack of Synchronization:** The drones are not moving in unison, causing an uncoordinated and uneven rose shape.
* **Non-Standard Altitude:** Drones do not fly at a constant altitude, creating a poor visual effect and affecting the overall shape.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the current trajectories are not satisfactory. They fail to meet the essential criteria of completeness, synchronization, and proper starting positions. 

**Previous Score:** 30/100

The feedback shows some improvement, although the trajectories still don't meet all the requirements. The score has increased, indicating that there's progress towards achieving the desired 3-petal rose curve formation.  The issues related to synchronization, incomplete petals, and starting positions still need to be addressed.

**Previous Score:** 20/100
**Current Score:** 20/100
**Change:** 0
**Verdict:**  **SAME**

While the feedback highlights some improvements in certain areas, such as continuity of paths and lack of collisions, the overall shape formed by the drones still doesn't match the desired 3-petal rose curve.  The key issues that need addressing remain:

* **Incomplete Trajectories:**  Each drone needs to trace a full 120-degree arc to complete its petal.
* **Incorrect Starting Formation:** The drones should start at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. 
* **Synchronization:**  The drones need to move in sync to create a seamless rose shape. 

Although there's been some progress, the score hasn't improved yet. The current trajectories are still considered invalid, and further adjustments are necessary to achieve the desired result.
