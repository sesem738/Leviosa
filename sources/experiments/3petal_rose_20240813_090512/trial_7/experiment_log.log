 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 3-Petal Rose Curve

This prompt requests the creation of a 3-petal rose pattern using 3 drones, each tracing out one petal. The requirement emphasizes a seamless, continuous pattern, implying the need for coordination and synchronization between the drones.

Here are the extracted requirements:

**[REQ] Number of drones: 3** 

**[REQ] Starting formation:** The drones should start in a triangular formation, with each drone positioned at one of the vertices of the triangle. This configuration ensures that the drones have enough initial separation to trace distinct petals without interfering.

**[REQ] Flight path:**

* **Overall shape:** Each drone will trace a single petal of the 3-petal rose curve. The petals should be identical in shape and size.
* **Coordinate system:** The drone trajectories will be defined in a 2D plane (assuming a flat surface).
* **Parametric equation:** A suitable parametric equation for the 3-petal rose curve is: 
    * x(t) = a*cos(3t)*cos(t)
    * y(t) = a*cos(3t)*sin(t) 
    * Where 'a' is a scaling factor determining the size of the rose and 't' is the parameter.
* **Drone assignment:** Each drone will be assigned to a unique section of the parameter 't' corresponding to one petal. For example:
    * Drone 1: 0 <= t <= 2π/3
    * Drone 2: 2π/3 <= t <= 4π/3
    * Drone 3: 4π/3 <= t <= 2π
* **Synchronization:** The drones must maintain a constant speed and synchronize their movements to ensure a continuous and seamless rose pattern.

**[REQ] Additional notes:**

* The drones should fly at a consistent altitude to avoid collisions and to maintain a clear visualization of the rose pattern.
* The 'a' scaling factor should be adjusted based on the desired size of the rose and the available flight space.
* This trajectory generation assumes ideal conditions without wind or obstacles.

The critics are still largely in agreement that the trajectories are not yet valid. The primary issue remains the overall shape not matching the required 3-petal rose curve. While some individual trajectories show continuity and completeness, the incorrect starting positions and lack of synchronization result in a distorted shape. However, the critics now seem to be more critical, focusing on specific issues like incomplete petals and deviation from the parametric equations.
