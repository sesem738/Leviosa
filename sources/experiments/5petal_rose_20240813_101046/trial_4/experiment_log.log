 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 5-Petal Rose Curve

This prompt describes a visual performance where five drones create a rose-shaped pattern. This requires coordinated movement and a specific formation. 

Here are the extracted requirements:

[REQ] Number of drones: 5
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should be positioned in a symmetrical pentagon formation, with each drone equidistant from the center of the formation and the other drones. This will allow for a balanced and visually pleasing starting point for the rose curve formation.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will follow a path that resembles a single petal of a rose. The five petals should be arranged in a symmetrical fashion, with each petal mirrored across the center point. The path can be modeled using a mathematical function (e.g., a rose curve equation) to ensure smooth and synchronized movements. This equation should be parametrized by time to ensure each drone moves along its petal at the same speed.
[REQ] Movement synchronization: The drones must maintain a synchronized movement throughout the flight. This can be achieved by using a common reference point (e.g., the center of the rose) and ensuring each drone reaches specific points in its trajectory at predetermined times.  
[REQ] Visual harmony: The drones' movement should create a visually harmonious rose shape. This can be achieved by adjusting the speed and timing of each drone's movement to create smooth transitions and a pleasing visual effect.

These requirements will allow the drones to create a dynamic and visually appealing rose curve.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The overall consensus is that the trajectories are not yet meeting the requirements for a five-petal rose curve. While the drones are moving continuously and smoothly, the paths they are taking are not forming the correct shape. 

**Common Issues:**

* **Symmetry:**  The petals of the rose are not symmetrical, with some being larger or smaller than others.
* **Shape:** The overall shape formed by the combined trajectories is not a complete five-petal rose.  It is either missing petals or forming a different shape altogether.
* **Synchronization:** There are concerns about the synchronization of the drones, with potential collisions occurring due to the close proximity of their paths.
* **Starting Positions:**  The drones are not consistently starting in the required symmetrical pentagon formation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Trajectory Equations:** The current trajectory equations need to be revised to accurately form the rose curve.  This likely involves implementing a parametric rose curve equation for each drone.
* **Synchronization:**  Ensure that the drones are moving in a synchronized manner. This will require careful adjustments to their speed and timing to create a smooth and harmonious visual effect.
* **Symmetry:**  Ensure the drones are starting in the correct position and adjust their paths to create symmetrical petals.
* **Starting Positions:**  The drones must be positioned in a symmetrical pentagon formation at the start.

Based on the previous feedback, the previous overall score was **60/100**. The current score is **40/100**.  Therefore, the score has **WORSE** by 20 points.

The overall consensus remains that the trajectories are still not meeting the requirements for a five-petal rose curve. 

**Common Issues:**

* **Shape:** The overall shape formed by the combined trajectories is not a complete five-petal rose. It's either missing petals or forming a different shape altogether.
* **Trajectory Type:** The drones are moving in circular paths, not petal-shaped paths as required.
* **Symmetry:**  The drones are not starting in a symmetrical pentagon formation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Trajectory Equations:** The current trajectory equations need to be revised to accurately form the rose curve. This likely involves implementing a parametric rose curve equation for each drone.
* **Starting Positions:** The drones need to begin in a symmetrical pentagon formation.
* **Synchronization:** Ensure that the drones are moving in a synchronized manner. This will require careful adjustments to their speed and timing to create a smooth and harmonious visual effect.

Based on the previous feedback, the previous overall score was **60/100**. The current score is **40/100**.  Therefore, the score has **WORSE** by 20 points.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback shows that the drones' performance has **worsened** since the previous evaluation.  

* **Previous score:** 60/100
* **Current score:** 40/100
* **Score change:** -20

The previous evaluation acknowledged some progress with smooth and continuous drone movements, but the overall shape was still not a 5-petal rose. The current feedback highlights even more issues:

* **Starting positions:** While previously close to a pentagon, the drones are now not even forming a pentagon.
* **Petal shape:** The current paths are not curved enough to form a rose shape. They're more like rounded loops.
* **Synchronization:** While previously mentioned, synchronization is now a bigger concern, with drones not reaching specific points in their trajectories at the same time.

The critics are unanimous in their opinion that a complete redesign of the drone trajectories is necessary to achieve the desired 5-petal rose curve formation.
