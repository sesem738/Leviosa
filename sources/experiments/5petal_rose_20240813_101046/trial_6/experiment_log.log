 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 5
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should start in a circular formation, evenly spaced around the center point of the intended rose curve. This is necessary to allow for simultaneous movement and formation of the petals.
[REQ] Flight path: 
    - Each drone will fly a path resembling a single petal of a rose. 
    - The paths should be symmetrically arranged around the center point, forming a 5-petal rose. 
    - To achieve the harmonious effect, the drones should move in a synchronized manner, with their speed and position adjustments calculated to ensure that the petals are formed at the same time and maintain a visually pleasing shape throughout the flight.
    - The trajectory can be defined using a parametric equation for a 5-petal rose curve, ensuring smooth and continuous movement for each drone. 
    - The drones should maintain a constant altitude throughout the flight.

```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Import `numpy`:** We need to import the `numpy` library for mathematical operations and array manipulation. 
2. **Define Waypoints:**
    - **Parametric Equation:** The parametric equation for a 5-petal rose curve is  `x = a*cos(t) + b*cos(5t), y = a*sin(t) + b*sin(5t)`, where 'a' and 'b' control the size and shape of the rose.
    - **Drone 1:**  We define `waypoints1` using the parametric equation. `t` values are generated using `np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 50)`, creating 50 points along the curve.
    - **Drone 2, 3, 4, 5:** We shift the starting angle (`t`) of each drone by `2*np.pi/5` to achieve the 5-petal rose formation. This ensures that each drone starts at a different position in the circle, creating a symmetrical pattern.
3. **Constant Altitude:** We set the `z` coordinate of each waypoint to `10` for all drones, ensuring they maintain a constant altitude. 
4. **Combine Waypoints:** We create a list `waypoints` containing all the drone waypoints.

**Code Explanation:**

- `np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 50)`: Creates an array of 50 evenly spaced values between 0 and 2*pi (one full rotation).
- `np.cos(t + i*2*np.pi/5)`: Calculates the x-coordinate of the waypoint using the parametric equation, shifting the angle (`t`) by `i*2*np.pi/5` for each drone.
- `np.sin(t + i*2*np.pi/5)`: Calculates the y-coordinate of the waypoint using the parametric equation, shifting the angle (`t`) by `i*2*np.pi/5` for each drone.

**Output:** 

This code generates a list of 5 lists, each representing the waypoints for a drone, forming a 5-petal rose pattern. The drones start in a circular formation and follow their respective rose petals, maintaining a constant altitude.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The overall consensus from the critics is that the drone trajectories are close to meeting the requirements but still have some key issues. While the drone paths are continuous and smooth, and the drones avoid collisions, the biggest problem is the overall shape formed by the trajectories.  The drones are not flying in a synchronized manner to create a symmetrical, 5-petal rose as required.  

Specifically, the critics point out:

* **Starting positions:**  The drones are generally starting in a circular formation, but they are not always evenly spaced.
* **Symmetry and shape:** The petals are not symmetrical and do not accurately resemble a 5-petal rose.
* **Synchronization:** The drones are not moving at the same speed, which results in uneven petal formation.
* **Completeness:**  Some of the drones stop before completing their petal trajectory.

**The previous score was 70/100.** 

The critics' scores for the current trajectories range from 20/100 to 40/100. This means the overall score has **decreased**. 

Based on the consensus, the score has **WORSE** significantly.

Feedback Summary:

The critics still generally agree that the trajectories are not valid. They all agree that the trajectories do not form a 5-petal rose, with most citing the drones forming a 5-pointed star instead. While some acknowledge the paths are continuous and there are no collisions, these are not enough to overcome the major issue of incorrect shape. 

There is a greater focus on the starting positions this time around.  The critics all note that the drones are not starting in the correct positions. Some criticize the drones starting on the same Z-plane, while others comment on the drones being off-center on the starting circle.

There is also some variation in the critiques regarding the completeness of the trajectories. Some critics found the trajectories to be incomplete in that they did not form the full path of the rose curve, while others noted that the trajectories were complete, but the shape was incorrect.

Overall, the critics agree that the trajectories need improvement.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The critics remain largely in agreement that the trajectories are **not valid**. The primary issue, consistent across all feedback, is that the drones do not form a 5-petal rose.  Several critics describe the resulting shape as a 5-pointed star instead. While the drones may exhibit continuous paths without collisions, this isn't enough to compensate for the fundamental shape mismatch.

This round of feedback sees a heightened focus on the starting positions.  The critics are unanimous in their assertion that the drones are not positioned correctly, with several highlighting issues like drones being on the same Z-plane or off-center on the starting circle.

Regarding the completeness of the trajectories, there's some divergence. While some critics see the trajectories as incomplete, suggesting they don't fully trace the rose curve, others perceive them as complete but forming an incorrect shape.

Overall, the consensus remains clear: the trajectories require significant improvement to achieve the desired 5-petal rose formation.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The critics are unanimous in their assessment that the drone trajectories are still **not valid**. While there are improvements in some areas, the fundamental issue of the drones not forming a 5-petal rose persists. This is the primary point of contention across all reviews. 

While some reviewers noted improvements in trajectory continuity and the absence of collisions, the shape formed by the drones is consistently identified as incorrect. Several reviews mention the resulting shape resembling a 5-pointed star instead of the desired rose. 

This round of feedback sees a strong focus on the starting positions of the drones. The critics agree that the drones are not positioned correctly, with issues like improper Z-plane alignment and off-center placement on the starting circle being highlighted.  

Regarding the completeness of the trajectories, opinions diverge. Some reviewers see the trajectories as incomplete, suggesting they do not fully trace the rose curve, while others perceive them as complete but forming an incorrect shape.

Overall, the consensus remains that the trajectories need significant revision to achieve the desired 5-petal rose formation.
