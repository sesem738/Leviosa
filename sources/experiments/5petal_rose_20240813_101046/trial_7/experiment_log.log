 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 5-Petal Rose Curve

This prompt requires the creation of a visually appealing, synchronized flight pattern resembling a five-petal rose. The drones will act as individual "petals" in this formation.

Here are the structured requirements:

[REQ] Number of drones: 5
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should begin in a circular formation, equally spaced at a radius that allows for the desired size of the rose pattern. This can be a circle with 5 points, with each drone occupying a point.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will follow a trajectory that resembles a single petal of a rose. This can be achieved using a modified polar equation, specifically a five-petal rose curve. The equation can be adjusted to control the size and orientation of the petals.
[REQ] Synchronization: The drones must synchronize their movements to ensure they reach each petal's peak and trough simultaneously, creating a harmonious, unified rose shape. This can be achieved by implementing a shared timer or using communication protocols for coordinated movement.
[REQ] Trajectory constraints: The trajectory should be smooth and continuous to avoid sudden changes in speed or direction, ensuring a graceful and aesthetically pleasing flight pattern.
[REQ] Flight duration: The duration of the flight pattern should be long enough to allow for a complete cycle of the rose curve. This can be adjusted based on desired speed and the overall size of the pattern.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback consistently points out the failure to achieve the 5-petal rose curve trajectory.  While the drones' paths are continuous and starting positions are correct, the overall shape formed is a circle, not the required rose. 

Key issues identified:

* **Incorrect trajectory:** Drones are not following the 5-petal rose curve equation, resulting in a circular pattern instead. 
* **Lack of synchronization:**  Drones are not moving in a coordinated way to achieve the peak and trough of each petal simultaneously.

Suggestions consistently recommend:

* **Implementation of a 5-petal rose curve:** Modify drone trajectories to match the equation of a 5-petal rose.
* **Synchronization:** Implement mechanisms to ensure synchronized movement for a visually appealing rose shape.
* **Smoothness and continuity:** Maintain a smooth and continuous trajectory for each drone to avoid abrupt changes in direction or speed.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback consistently highlights the failure to achieve the desired five-petal rose trajectory using drone movements.  While the drones' paths are generally continuous and starting positions are correct, the overall shape formed is not a rose, but rather a circle or a single-looped circle.  Synchronization of drone movement is also lacking. 

**Key issues identified:**

* **Incorrect trajectory:** Drones are not following the five-petal rose curve equation, resulting in a circular or single-looped pattern instead.
* **Lack of synchronization:** Drones are not moving in a coordinated way to achieve the peak and trough of each petal simultaneously.
* **Insufficient 3D Formation:** The rose should be formed in three dimensions, not just in the XY plane. 

**Suggestions consistently recommend:**

* **Implementation of a five-petal rose curve:** Modify drone trajectories to match the equation of a five-petal rose.
* **Synchronization:** Implement mechanisms to ensure synchronized movement for a visually appealing rose shape.
* **Smoothness and continuity:** Maintain a smooth and continuous trajectory for each drone to avoid abrupt changes in direction or speed.
* **3D Rose Formation:** Ensure the rose is formed in three dimensions.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback is generally positive, suggesting improvements in the drone trajectories since the previous evaluation. While the drones still haven't fully achieved the desired five-petal rose curve, there's significant progress in several areas.

**Key Improvements:**

* **Improved Synchronization:** The feedback now suggests that the drones are moving more synchronously, though this may still need further refinement.
* **More Consistent Starting Positions:**  The starting positions are now described as "equally spaced" or forming a proper circular formation, indicating improvement in their arrangement.

**Remaining Issues:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory:** The drones are still not forming a five-petal rose, though there is some indication that they may be getting closer to a correct three-dimensional shape. 

**Suggestions:**

The feedback continues to recommend utilizing a modified polar equation for a five-petal rose to ensure the correct trajectory. Fine-tuning the synchronization and 3D formation remain important for a visually appealing result.
