 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback consistently highlights the most significant issue: **the drones are not flying along a hyperbolic trajectory, but rather in straight lines.** This fundamental flaw is consistently pointed out by all critics. 

Additional issues include:

* **Starting Positions:** The drones do not start at the foci of the hyperbola, contradicting the requirements. 
* **Overall Shape:** The combined shape formed by the drones' paths does not resemble a hyperbola, failing to meet the specification.
* **Symmetry:** While some critics mention continuity and smoothness, the most critical concern is the lack of a symmetrical, visually appealing movement due to the linear paths. 

The feedback consistently points out these shortcomings, resulting in a **score of 0/100** across all evaluations.

**Previous Score: N/A (No previous feedback provided)**

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback is mixed, with a clear consensus that the **drone trajectories are not following a hyperbolic path as required**.  While all critics acknowledge that the trajectories are not valid, there is some disagreement on the specific shortcomings.

**Common Issues:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:** The most prominent issue is that the drones do not follow a hyperbolic path. This is a fundamental requirement that is consistently not met. Some critics suggest the trajectories resemble straight lines or curved paths that do not resemble a hyperbola. 
* **Starting Positions:** Several critics note that the drones are not starting at the foci of the hyperbola, as required by the task. 

**Less Consistent Issues:**

* **Symmetry:** While some critics mention the lack of symmetry in the trajectories due to the differing paths, others don't specifically address this aspect.
* **Completeness:** Some critics argue the trajectories are incomplete, while others find them complete based on their specific interpretation of the requirement.
* **Overall Shape:**  There is disagreement on whether the overall shape formed by the combined trajectories is acceptable, with some seeing it as a hyperbola and others finding it doesn't meet the criteria. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The suggestions for improvement focus on creating a correct hyperbolic trajectory:

* **Use a mathematical function:**  Generate a hyperbolic path for both drones using a suitable mathematical function.
* **Adjust starting positions:**  Place the drones at the foci of the desired hyperbola.
* **Maintain symmetry:** Ensure the drones trace congruent branches of the hyperbola.
* **Synchronize speed:**  Ensure both drones maintain synchronized speeds for visual appeal and symmetry.
* **Smooth acceleration and deceleration:** Include smooth acceleration and deceleration at the start and end of the trajectories. 

## Score Summary:

**Previous Score: N/A (No previous feedback provided)**

**Current Score: 18/100**  

**Change: +18**

**Overall:** The score has **improved**, moving from 0/100 to 18/100. This improvement indicates some progress towards meeting the requirements, but the core issue of the non-hyperbolic trajectory still needs significant attention.

The feedback is largely consistent, with all critics agreeing that the drone trajectories are not valid and do not form a hyperbola as required.  

**Common Issues:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:** The drones do not follow a hyperbolic path. This is the most significant issue, as it directly contradicts the core requirement.  
* **Starting Positions:**  All critics agree that the drones are not starting at the foci of the hyperbola, which is crucial for creating the correct shape.  
* **Symmetry:**  A majority of critics highlight the lack of symmetry between the drones' trajectories. 
* **Synchronization:** All critics noted that the drones' speed is not synchronized.

**Less Consistent Issues:**

* **Completeness:** There is some disagreement on whether the trajectories are considered complete. 
* **Overall Shape:**  The overall shape formed by the combined trajectories is not consistently evaluated, with varying opinions on whether it resembles a hyperbola. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The suggestions revolve around correcting the trajectory and achieving a proper hyperbolic formation:

* **Use a mathematical function:** Utilize a suitable mathematical function to generate a hyperbolic path for both drones.
* **Adjust starting positions:** Ensure the drones start at the foci of the desired hyperbola.
* **Maintain symmetry:** The drones should trace congruent branches of the hyperbola.
* **Synchronize speed:**  Maintain synchronized speeds for both drones to ensure symmetry and visual appeal.
* **Smooth acceleration and deceleration:** Include smooth acceleration and deceleration at the start and end of the trajectories.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback from the critics remains largely negative. While there are some improvements in the trajectory generation, the fundamental issues persist, preventing the drones from forming the required hyperbolic shape.

**Common Issues:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:** The most significant issue remains the drones' failure to follow a hyperbolic path. Many critics emphasize the lack of a proper curved trajectory, with some even mentioning straight lines instead of hyperbolic branches.
* **Starting Positions:** The starting positions of the drones are still a point of contention. While some critics acknowledge the placement at the foci, others still highlight incorrect positioning.
* **Symmetry:**  The lack of symmetry between the drone trajectories is a major concern. The drones are not tracing congruent branches of a hyperbola, which is crucial for the intended effect. 
* **Speed Synchronization:** The drones are still not moving at synchronized speeds, further hindering the overall visual appeal and symmetry of the formation. 

**Less Consistent Issues:**

* **Completeness:** There is still disagreement on whether the trajectories are considered complete. 
* **Overall Shape:** There is no clear consensus on the overall shape formed by the combined trajectories, with some critics not seeing a clear hyperbola shape emerging.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The critics consistently recommend focusing on:

* **Correcting the Trajectory Shape:** Utilizing a mathematical function to define the hyperbolic path and ensuring the drones accurately trace this path.
* **Ensuring Correct Starting Positions:** Positioning the drones at the foci of the desired hyperbola to enable symmetrical branches.
* **Achieving Symmetry:** Adjusting the trajectories to ensure the drones trace congruent branches of the hyperbola, maintaining a symmetrical formation.
* **Synchronizing Speed:** Adjusting the drone speeds to move at the same pace, enhancing visual appeal and symmetry.
* **Smooth Acceleration and Deceleration:** Ensuring smooth transitions at the start and end of the trajectories for a visually appealing flight. 

## Score Summary:

**Previous Score: 0/100**

**Current Score: 0/100**

**Change: 0**

**Overall:** The score has **NOT IMPROVED** and remains at 0/100. This indicates that the core issues with the trajectory shape, starting positions, and lack of symmetry have not been addressed. While some improvements might have been made, the fundamental flaws persist, requiring significant revisions to achieve the desired outcome.
