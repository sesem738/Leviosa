2024-08-10 13:15:21,007 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting positions: The two drones should be positioned symmetrically on the x-axis, with equal distance from the origin (0, 0). The exact distance will determine the scale of the hyperbola.
[REQ] Flight path: 
    * Each drone will follow one branch of a hyperbolic path.
    * The drones should move in opposite directions along their respective branches.
    * The drones should maintain a constant velocity along their hyperbolic paths. 
    * The hyperbola should be centered at the origin (0, 0).
    * The path should be smooth and continuous, avoiding any sharp turns or abrupt changes in direction.
    * The hyperbola's equation can be defined by: (x^2/a^2) - (y^2/b^2) = 1, where a and b are constants that control the shape of the hyperbola. 
[REQ] Formation: The drones should maintain a symmetrical formation throughout the flight, with each drone tracing its respective branch of the hyperbola.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics highlights several consistent issues:

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:** The most critical issue is that the drones' paths do not follow the required hyperbolic shape.  They either form a more parabolic or linear trajectory, or are not symmetrical enough.
* **Symmetry:** The starting positions are often described as symmetrical, but the drones' paths are not symmetrical with respect to the origin. 
* **Direction of Movement:**  The drones frequently move in the same direction rather than in opposite directions as specified. 
* **Constant Velocity:**  There are concerns about whether the drones are maintaining a constant velocity along their paths. 

**Overall Consensus:**  The critics unanimously agree that the trajectories do not meet the specified requirements. 

**Previous Score:** 20/100
**Current Score:** 10/100 
**Score Change:** -10. **WORSE**

**Feedback Summary:**

The critics consistently highlight the following issues:

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:**  The drones' paths consistently fail to follow the required hyperbolic shape, often deviating to straight lines or non-symmetrical curves.
* **Symmetry:** While the starting positions are sometimes considered symmetrical, the drone paths lack overall symmetry with respect to the origin.
