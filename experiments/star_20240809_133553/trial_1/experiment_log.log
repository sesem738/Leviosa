 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Star Formation

Here are the structured requirements for a drone control system to create a star trajectory using 5 drones:

[REQ] Number of drones: 5
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should begin in a circular formation, equally spaced around a central point. This point will serve as the center of the star.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will fly a path shaped like a pointed arc, forming one point of the star. To achieve this:
    - Each drone will start its arc from a point on the circle, moving outward radially from the center. 
    - They will then fly in a curved path that intersects with another drone's arc at a point further from the center.
    - This intersection point will be a point of the star.
    - The drone will continue its curved path until it reaches a point directly opposite its starting point on the circle, thus completing its arc.
    - The drones will fly their arcs in a staggered sequence, starting with one drone and then proceeding clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle.
    - The angle of each drone's arc should be determined such that the intersection points form a symmetrical star.
[REQ] Drone speed: The drones should maintain a constant speed throughout the trajectory, allowing for a smooth and synchronized flight.
[REQ] Altitude: All drones should maintain a constant altitude throughout the trajectory.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics highlights several common issues with the drone trajectories:

* **Shape:** The drones do not form a symmetrical star shape. The intersection points are either too close together or do not form well-defined points.
* **Completeness:** The drones do not complete a full arc to return to their starting position.
* **Starting positions:** While the drones start in a circular formation, the starting positions are not always aligned with the requirement of being equally spaced.
* **Symmetry:**  The arcs are not symmetrical, leading to an uneven star shape.

**Overall Consensus:** The critics agree that the current trajectories are not valid and require significant adjustments to meet the requirements. They recommend focusing on improving the symmetry of the star, adjusting the angles and curvature of the arcs, and ensuring that the drones complete a full arc back to their starting point.

**Previous Score:**  The previous score was not provided in the feedback, so it is impossible to calculate the score improvement.

**Current Score:** Based on the individual scores provided in the feedback, the current overall score is likely to be around **40/100**. This is because the majority of the critiques give a score of 40 or less. 

**Score Change:** Without the previous score, we cannot determine if the score has improved or decreased.
