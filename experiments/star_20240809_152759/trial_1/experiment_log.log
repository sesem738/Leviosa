 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Star Formation

Here are the structured requirements for a drone trajectory to form a star shape using 5 drones:

[REQ] Number of drones: 5
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should begin in a circular formation, equidistant from the center point of the intended star. This ensures a symmetrical starting point for the star formation.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will fly in a straight line towards a point on the intended star's outer edge, then follow a curved trajectory inward along a "star point" to meet at the center. The drones should maintain a constant speed throughout their flight, resulting in a synchronized and visually appealing star formation.
[REQ] Trajectory shape: The overall trajectory of the drones will resemble a five-pointed star, with each drone's path forming one point of the star. The five paths should converge at the center of the star.
[REQ] Synchronization:  The drones must be synchronized in their movements to ensure they arrive at their respective star points simultaneously and maintain the star shape throughout the flight.
[REQ] Formation Maintenance: The drones should maintain a roughly equal distance from each other throughout the flight to avoid collisions and maintain the visual aesthetic of the star.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories do not form a valid star shape. While the drones move in a circular formation and their paths are continuous, they fail to converge at the center point of the star, resulting in an incomplete and inaccurate star formation. 

The critics highlight several issues:

* **Incomplete Trajectories:** The drones' paths do not form the points of a star accurately. Some arcs are too large, while others are too small, leading to an uneven and distorted star shape.
* **Synchronization Issues:** The drones are not synchronized in their movements, which prevents them from forming a unified star shape. Some drones reach their target points earlier or later than others.
* **Positioning Issues:** While the drones start in a circular formation, they are not perfectly equidistant from the center point, impacting the symmetry and aesthetics of the star. 

The critics offer various suggestions for improvement:

* **Refine Drone Paths:** Adjust the arc lengths of each drone's path to create a balanced and symmetrical star shape.
* **Improve Synchronization:** Ensure the drones move at synchronized speeds to reach their target points simultaneously.
* **Adjust Starting Positions:** Ensure the drones start equidistant from the center point to maintain a perfectly symmetrical circular formation.

**Overall Score:**

The critics' scores indicate a range of performance.  While the original score was **15/100**, the updated score based on the new feedback is a **70/100**. This is a significant improvement, indicating progress made in addressing the initial issues.  **BETTER**.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories still do not form a valid star shape. While some progress has been made, there are still issues with the drones' paths not converging at the center point, resulting in an incomplete and inaccurate star formation.

Here's a breakdown of the common points:

* **Convergence Issues:** The drones are still not converging at the center point of the star, leading to a distorted shape.
* **Synchronization Issues:** The drones are not always synchronized in their movements, which impacts the formation of the star.
* **Formation Maintenance:** The drones do not always maintain a roughly equal distance from each other throughout the flight, affecting the visual aesthetics of the star.

Some critics highlight specific issues like incomplete trajectories and incorrect starting positions. However, the majority agree on the need for improvements in synchronization and convergence.

Overall, while some critics acknowledge improvements, the consensus is that the drone trajectories still need significant work to achieve a proper star shape.

**Score Comparison:**

* **Previous Score:** 15/100
* **Current Score:** 30/100 
* **Score Change:** +15 **BETTER**

The critics agree that the drone trajectories are still not forming a valid star shape. However, there is some improvement over the previous attempt. There is a consensus that the drones' movements are more continuous, with no sudden jumps or breaks in their paths. While the drones do converge towards the center, they are still not following the required curved trajectories to form a proper star shape. The starting positions are also not completely accurate. 

Overall, while the drones are moving more smoothly, the overall shape formed by their trajectories is still far from a valid star.

**Score Comparison:**

* **Previous Score:** 15/100
* **Current Score:** 30/100
* **Score Change:** +15 **BETTER**
