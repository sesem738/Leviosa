 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Triple Helix Pattern

**Interpretation:** The command requests a specific drone formation ("triple helix pattern") with synchronized movement and uniform spacing. This implies a coordinated flight path involving multiple drones.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 3
[REQ] Starting formation:  The drones should be positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, with each drone representing one strand of the helix. 
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone should follow a helical path, ascending along the vertical axis while maintaining a circular trajectory in the horizontal plane. The drones should be synchronized such that they form a continuous helix, with each drone's path offset by 120 degrees from the others. 
[REQ] Spacing: The drones should maintain a constant and uniform distance from each other throughout the flight, forming a consistent helix pattern. 
[REQ] Synchronization:  All drones must maintain synchronized movement to avoid collisions and ensure a smooth, continuous helix formation.
[REQ]  Coordination:  A communication system is required for the drones to coordinate their movements and maintain synchronized flight.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback consistently points out that the trajectories do not form a triple helix pattern. The main issues are:

* **Lack of helical paths:** The drones' paths are not true helices, they are more like circles or loops.
* **No synchronization:** The drones' movements are not synchronized, which is crucial for creating a continuous helix.
* **Incorrect spacing:** The drones don't maintain a uniform distance from each other, which also disrupts the helix formation.

While the starting positions are generally correct, the lack of a proper helical trajectory and synchronization prevent the drones from achieving the desired result. 

The score seems to be consistently around **20/100**.  There is no improvement or decrease, as the score has remained the same throughout the feedback.
