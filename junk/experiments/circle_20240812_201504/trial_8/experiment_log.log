 ## Requirements for Drone Circular Trajectory:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 2
**[REQ] Starting formation:** The drones should begin in a line, positioned directly opposite each other at the diameter endpoints of the intended circle.
**[REQ] Flight path:**  Both drones will trace a semicircular path in a synchronized manner.
    * **Drone 1:**  Will fly a clockwise semicircle starting from its initial position, ending at the midpoint of the circle's diameter.
    * **Drone 2:** Will fly a counter-clockwise semicircle starting from its initial position, ending at the midpoint of the circle's diameter.
**[REQ] Synchronization:** Both drones must maintain a constant speed and synchronized movement throughout their respective semicircles. This ensures that the two semicircles combine to form a complete circle.
**[REQ] Circle diameter:** The diameter of the circle should be determined based on the available space and desired size of the circular trajectory. 
**[REQ] Flight altitude:** The drones should maintain a constant altitude throughout the trajectory. This altitude should be determined based on safety considerations and the overall context of the operation.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics reveals a consistent issue: **Drone 2's trajectory is not a complete semicircle, hindering the formation of a complete circle.**  While all critics agree that the drones start in the correct positions and maintain continuous paths, the overall shape formed by the combined trajectories consistently fails to meet the requirement of a circle.  

Here's a summary of the common points:

* **Drone 2's trajectory:**  The primary issue is that Drone 2's path is a straight line or an incomplete semicircle, preventing the formation of a complete circle.
* **Synchronization:** Several critics emphasize the need for synchronized movement and consistent speed between the drones to ensure a smooth and accurate circular formation.
* **Circle Formation:** There is a lack of consistency in the shape of the circle, with some feedback mentioning an elongated oval or a too-small diameter. 
* **Collision potential:** One critic points out the potential safety hazard of drones flying too close to each other, suggesting the need for greater spacing between them.

**Overall consensus:** The feedback suggests that the trajectories are not valid and require significant adjustments, particularly for Drone 2's trajectory to form a complete semicircle.  

**Previous Score:** Based on the provided feedback, the previous score was **40/100**.

**Current Score:** You did not provide the current score, so I cannot determine the improvement or decrease. Please provide the current score.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics suggests that the overall trajectory has **improved**, although not to a satisfactory level. Here's a breakdown:

* **Previous Score:** 40/100
* **Current Score:** You did not provide the current score. Please provide it for a complete analysis.

**Here's why the score likely improved:**

* **Drone 2's Trajectory:** While the critics still highlight issues with Drone 2's trajectory, there's a noticeable improvement. The feedback now mentions that Drone 2's path is sometimes a straight line, but in other cases, it is an incomplete semicircle. This suggests that there's progress in the direction of a complete semicircle. 
* **Starting Positions:**  The feedback consistently praises the drones' starting positions, indicating this aspect has been successfully implemented.
* **Continuity:** The feedback consistently highlights the continuity and smoothness of the drone trajectories, indicating a positive step towards a well-executed flight plan. 

**Here's why the score is not yet satisfactory:**

* **Drone 2's Trajectory:**  The feedback still emphasizes the need for Drone 2 to complete a full semicircle. This remains the primary hurdle in achieving a valid trajectory.
* **Synchronization:** While there is a mention of synchronized movement, the feedback does not consistently state that the drones are moving at the same speed, which is crucial for a smooth circular formation.
* **Shape:** There are still mentions of the overall shape not forming a perfect circle. Some feedback mentions an elongated oval or a smaller diameter, suggesting that the trajectory still needs refinements.

**To determine if the score has improved or worsened, please provide the current score.**

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics agree that the overall shape of the drones' trajectories does not meet the requirements. While Drone 1 has achieved a continuous, semicircular path, Drone 2 still needs significant work to form a complete semicircle.  The main issues identified are:

- **Drone 2's Trajectory:**  The trajectory of Drone 2 is incorrect, either not forming a semicircle, ending at the wrong location, or moving in a straight line. 
- **Synchronization:** While not explicitly mentioned in every feedback, the lack of synchronization between the drones is a recurring concern. Critics suggest that both drones must move at the same speed to ensure synchronized movement and achieve the desired circular formation. 

**Overall Consensus:** 

The feedback highlights a clear need for improvement in Drone 2's trajectory.  There's a consensus that Drone 2 needs to be adjusted to form a proper semicircle and end at the midpoint of the circle's diameter.  Synchronized movement of the drones is also crucial to achieve the desired outcome.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics remain largely in agreement that the drone trajectories are not meeting the requirements. While Drone 1's trajectory is generally considered acceptable, Drone 2 continues to be the main problem.  The central issue is Drone 2's failure to form a complete semicircle, either moving in a straight line or ending at an incorrect location.  A few critics also point out that the drones need to move synchronously at a constant speed to achieve a proper circular formation.

**Overall Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectories are still significantly flawed and require significant correction. Drone 2 must be adjusted to create a full, properly-oriented semicircle.  Synchronization between the drones is crucial to ensure a complete circular formation.
