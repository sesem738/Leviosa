 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The critics generally agree that the drone trajectories are not valid.  The main issues identified are:

* **Incomplete Circle:**  Both drones fail to complete a full circular path, resulting in an incomplete circle formation. 
* **Starting Positions:** Some critics point out issues with the starting positions not being on the same plane, preventing the formation of a complete circle.
* **Synchronization:**  The drones need better synchronization to ensure their paths overlap seamlessly and form a continuous circle. 

While the critics acknowledge that the drones' paths are continuous and collision-free, the incomplete circle formation and incorrect starting positions prevent the trajectories from meeting the requirements.

## Score Analysis:

* **Previous Score:**  Based on the provided feedback, the **previous score** was **30/100**.
* **Current Score:**  The **current score** is **40/100**. 
* **Score Change:** The score has **improved** by **+10**, indicating **BETTER** performance.

While the score has improved, it is important to note that it is still far from the desired 100/100. The drone trajectories need significant adjustments to meet all the requirements.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The critics remain largely in agreement that the drone trajectories are not yet valid. The primary issues persist:

* **Incomplete Circle:**  The drones still fail to complete a full circular path, resulting in an incomplete formation. Several critics note that the trajectories are either semi-circles or quarter-circles, far from the required full circle.
* **Synchronization:** The lack of synchronization between the drones continues to be a concern.  Although some critics mention the drones maintaining similar speeds, the lack of a complete circle makes synchronization irrelevant for forming the desired shape.

While the starting positions are generally deemed appropriate, the incomplete trajectories and synchronization issues remain the major obstacles. 

## Score Analysis:

* **Previous Score:** Based on the provided feedback, the **previous score** was **30/100**.
* **Current Score:** The **current score** is **40/100**. 
* **Score Change:** The score has **improved** by **+10**, indicating **BETTER** performance.

Despite the score improvement, the trajectories still fall significantly short of the requirements. The drones must complete full circles and maintain synchronized movements to achieve the desired circular formation.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are close to being correct, but still require significant adjustments. While the starting positions are generally considered acceptable, the primary issue remains the **incompletion of the circular path**.  Most drones only execute semi-circles, failing to complete the full circle formation.

**Common Issues:**

* **Incomplete Circle:**  The drones do not create a complete circle, instead forming semi-circles or partial arcs.
* **Lack of Synchronization:**  Although some critics note the drones move at similar speeds, the incomplete paths prevent proper synchronization to achieve a seamless circular formation.
* **Potential Collision:**  Due to the incomplete trajectories, some critics highlight the potential for collisions as the drones approach each other's starting positions. 

**Positive Points:**

* **Continuous Paths:**  All critics agree that the drone paths are continuous and smooth.
* **Correct Starting Position:** The drones are consistently placed at the correct starting positions, on opposite ends of a diameter.

## Score Analysis:

* **Previous Score:** 30/100
* **Current Score:** 70/100
* **Score Change:** +40, **BETTER** performance. 

While the drone trajectories still have room for improvement, the scores have increased significantly, indicating progress towards achieving the desired circular formation.  Adjusting the drone paths to complete full circles and synchronizing their movement are crucial steps to further enhance the performance.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are still not valid, but there has been some improvement.  While the starting positions are now generally considered acceptable, the primary issue remains the **incompletion of the circular path**.  

**Common Issues:**

* **Incomplete Circle:** The drones do not create a complete circle, instead forming semi-circles or partial arcs.
* **Synchronization Issues:**  The drones are not moving in the same direction and may not be moving at the same speed, preventing proper synchronization to achieve a seamless circular formation.
* **Trajectory Anomalies:** Some drones have sudden jumps in their trajectories, which are not acceptable.
* **Distance Maintenance:**  Drones are not maintaining a consistent distance from each other, leading to potential collisions.

**Positive Points:**

* **Continuous Paths:** Most critics agree that the drone paths are continuous and smooth.
* **Correct Starting Position:** The drones are consistently placed at the correct starting positions, on opposite ends of a diameter.

## Score Analysis:

* **Previous Score:** 30/100
* **Current Score:** 20/100
* **Score Change:** -10, **WORSE** performance. 

The drone trajectories have worsened since the last evaluation.  The main issues that need to be addressed are the incomplete circular paths, lack of synchronization, and the sudden jumps in some trajectories.

 Feedback Summary:
## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are still not valid, but there has been some improvement.  While the starting positions are now generally considered acceptable, the primary issue remains the **incompletion of the circular path**.  

**Common Issues:**

* **Incomplete Circle:** The drones do not create a complete circle, instead forming semi-circles or partial arcs. This is because some drones fail to complete their full semicircular path, leaving gaps in the intended circle formation.
* **Synchronization Issues:**  The drones are not moving at the same speed or in a synchronized manner, preventing proper formation and potentially leading to collisions.
* **Trajectory Anomalies:** Some drones exhibit sudden jumps or breaks in their paths, which are not acceptable.
* **Distance Maintenance:**  Drones are not maintaining a consistent distance from each other, leading to potential collisions and an uneven circular formation.

**Positive Points:**

* **Continuous Paths:** Most critics agree that the drone paths are continuous and smooth, with no abrupt stops or changes in direction.
* **Correct Starting Position:** The drones are consistently placed at the correct starting positions, on opposite ends of a diameter.

## Score Analysis:

* **Previous Score:** 30/100
* **Current Score:** 40/100
* **Score Change:** +10, **BETTER** performance. 

The drone trajectories have improved slightly since the last evaluation.  The main issues that need to be addressed are the incomplete circular paths, lack of synchronization, and the sudden jumps in some trajectories.  Focus on ensuring all drones complete their designated semi-circular paths simultaneously while maintaining consistent distance and speed.

## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The overall consensus is that the drone trajectories have significantly improved since the last evaluation, but still require adjustments to fully meet the requirements.  

**Common Issues:**

* **Incomplete Circle:**  While the drones are generally moving in the right direction, they still haven't fully formed a complete circle. Some drones don't finish their semi-circular paths, leading to gaps in the intended formation.
* **Minor Synchronization Issues:**  While the drones move generally at the same speed, there are still slight discrepancies, particularly near the starting point, impacting perfect synchronization. 

**Positive Points:**

* **Continuous Paths:**  All critics agree that the drone paths are now continuous and smooth, without any abrupt changes in direction. 
* **Correct Starting Positions:** The drones are consistently starting in the correct positions, on opposite ends of the intended circle diameter.
* **No Anomalies:** The trajectories are generally smooth and without sudden jumps or breaks. 
* **Safe Distance Maintenance:** The drones maintain a safe distance from each other, eliminating the possibility of collisions.

* **Current Score:** 70/100
* **Score Change:** +40, **BETTER** performance. 

The drone trajectories have shown significant improvement, moving closer to achieving a valid circular formation.  The primary focus should be on completing the circular path by ensuring all drones complete their semi-circular trajectories smoothly, while maintaining perfect synchronization and constant distance.

## Summary of Critic Feedback:

The consensus is that the drone trajectories have made significant progress since the last evaluation, with a clear improvement in overall performance. 

**Common Issues:**

* **Incomplete Circle:** While the drones are executing semi-circular paths, the overall shape formed by their combined trajectories still doesn't form a complete circle. This suggests issues with path completion and potential lack of perfect synchronization. 
* **Minor Synchronization Issues:**  Although the drones are moving at a generally similar pace, there are still slight variations in their speed, specifically at the starting points, hindering a perfectly synchronized movement.

**Positive Points:**

* **Continuous Paths:** All critics agree that the drone paths are now continuous and smooth, with no sudden changes in direction.
* **Correct Starting Positions:** The drones consistently start in the appropriate positions, on opposite ends of the intended circle diameter.
* **No Anomalies or Collisions:** The trajectories are free from sudden jumps or breaks, ensuring a safe distance between the drones. 

## Score Analysis:

* **Previous Score:** 30/100
* **Current Score:** 70/100
* **Score Change:** +40, **BETTER** performance. 

The drone trajectories demonstrate significant improvement, moving closer to achieving a valid circular formation. The primary focus should be on completing the circular path by ensuring all drones finish their semi-circular trajectories smoothly and simultaneously.  This will require ensuring perfect synchronization and a constant distance between the drones throughout the flight.
