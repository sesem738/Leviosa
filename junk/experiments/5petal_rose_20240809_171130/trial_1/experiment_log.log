 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 5-Petal Rose

This prompt requests a synchronized drone formation that visually represents a five-petal rose.  Here are the requirements for this trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 5 
    *  One drone per petal is required to achieve the desired rose shape.

[REQ] Starting formation:  
    * Drones should start in a circular formation, evenly spaced around a central point. This simplifies the initial configuration and allows for a smooth transition into the rose shape. 
    *  The radius of this initial circle should be chosen to accommodate the final rose size, allowing the petals to fully form without collisions. 

[REQ] Flight path:
    * Each drone will trace a portion of a rose curve, creating a single petal.
    * The drones should be synchronized so they start and end their petal trajectories simultaneously, ensuring a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing rose shape.
    *  The five rose curves should be evenly distributed around the central point, creating a balanced and visually appealing rose.
    *  The drone trajectories should be mathematically defined to ensure precise and predictable petal formation.

[REQ] Speed and acceleration: 
    * Drones should maintain a constant speed along their individual petal trajectories.
    *  The speed should be chosen to allow for smooth and visually appealing movements while ensuring that the drones complete their paths within a reasonable time.

[REQ] Altitude: 
    * Drones should maintain a constant altitude throughout the flight. The specific altitude should be chosen based on safety and visual considerations.

[REQ]  Synchronization: 
    * A robust synchronization mechanism is required to ensure all five drones move in unison, resulting in a perfectly formed rose. 
    * The synchronization should account for potential slight variations in drone speeds and performance.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories provided are not valid for creating a five-petal rose.  While the drones move continuously without collisions, the overall shape formed does not resemble a rose. 

**Common issues highlighted:**

* **Petal Shape and Distribution:** The petals are not evenly distributed or aligned, leading to an asymmetrical and visually unappealing rose.
* **Synchronization:**  The drones lack synchronization, causing the petals to form a star shape instead of a cohesive rose. 
* **Starting Positions:** The drones don't always start in a circular formation, impacting the smoothness of the final shape. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Mathematical Approach:** Utilize mathematical equations, specifically the rose curve equation, to precisely define the drone trajectories for a perfect petal shape.
* **Synchronization:** Implement a robust synchronization mechanism to ensure all drones start and finish their paths simultaneously.
* **Starting Positions:** Ensure that the drones start in a perfect circular formation, evenly spaced around the central point.

**Overall, the critics agree that significant revisions are required to achieve a valid five-petal rose shape.**

Based on the feedback provided, the previous overall score was **25/100**, and the current score is **40/100**. This indicates that the score has **improved** by **+15**. The feedback indicates that the current trajectories are closer to the desired shape, but still require substantial improvements.

While there are some improvements, specifically in terms of continuous paths and no collisions, the overall shape still doesn't resemble a five-petal rose. In fact, the feedback suggests that the trajectories are even further from the desired shape than before, with some drones exhibiting disconnected paths and potential collisions between drones. This highlights the need for more fundamental revisions to achieve the intended outcome.

The previous overall score was **20/100**. The current score is **0/100**. This means the score has **decreased** by **-20**, making it **WORSE**. 

The critics are unanimous in their assessment that the drone trajectories still do not form a valid 5-petal rose. While some aspects have improved, such as continuous paths and the absence of collisions, the fundamental issues remain. The drones are not following the correct rose curve equations, their starting positions are not uniformly spaced, and there's no synchronization between their movements. 

The feedback highlights a need for significant revisions, not just tweaks, to achieve the desired outcome. The use of mathematical models to generate the trajectories and ensure synchronization is strongly recommended.

Feedback Summary:

The previous overall score was **84/100**. The current score is **60/100**. This means the score has **decreased** by **-24**, making it **WORSE**. 

While the critics acknowledge some improvements, such as continuous paths and the absence of collisions, the overall shape still does not form a recognizable five-petal rose. The key issues remain:

* **Incorrect Rose Shape:** The trajectories are closer to a star shape than a rose, indicating a fundamental flaw in the curve equations used.
* **Uneven Starting Positions:** Although the drones start in a circular formation, the spacing is not perfectly uniform, hindering the symmetry of the final shape.
* **Lack of Synchronization:** While the image suggests some unison, achieving a perfect rose requires precise timing and synchronization between drones.

The critics emphasize the need for significant adjustments to the trajectory equations and drone positioning to achieve a more accurate and visually pleasing five-petal rose formation.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The previous overall score was **0/100**. The current score is **0/100**. This means the score has **not changed**, making it **neither better nor worse**. 

While the critics acknowledge some improvements, such as continuous paths and the absence of collisions, the overall shape still does not form a recognizable five-petal rose. The key issues remain:

* **Incorrect Rose Shape:** The trajectories are closer to a star shape than a rose, indicating a fundamental flaw in the curve equations used.
* **Uneven Starting Positions:** Although the drones start in a circular formation, the spacing is not perfectly uniform, hindering the symmetry of the final shape.
* **Lack of Synchronization:** While the image suggests some unison, achieving a perfect rose requires precise timing and synchronization between drones.

The critics emphasize the need for significant adjustments to the trajectory equations and drone positioning to achieve a more accurate and visually pleasing five-petal rose formation.
