 ## Requirements for Double Conical Helix Drone Trajectory:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 2 

**[REQ] Starting formation:** Drones start at the base of each cone, positioned symmetrically on opposite sides of the central axis.

**[REQ] Flight path:** Each drone will trace a conical helix path, forming a double helix pattern. 

**[REQ] Path shape:** 
* Each helix should be symmetrical and have a smooth, continuous curve.
* Both cones should be identical in size and orientation. 
* The distance between the drone paths should be constant throughout the trajectory. 

**[REQ] Movement parameters:** 
* The drones should maintain a consistent upward velocity throughout the trajectory.
* The drones should maintain a consistent horizontal velocity, resulting in a constant spiral angle. 
* The drones should maintain a consistent angular velocity, resulting in a consistent helix pitch.

**[REQ] Synchronization:** Both drones should start and complete their trajectories simultaneously to maintain the symmetrical double helix formation.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The overall consensus from the critics is that the trajectories are close to meeting the requirements for a double conical helix, but there are several flaws that need to be addressed.

**Common Issues:**

* **Synchronization:** Several critics noted that the drones are not perfectly synchronized, with one drone often completing a loop before the other.
* **Cone Size and Alignment:** The cones formed by the helixes are often not identical in size and orientation, and they are not always aligned properly.
* **Distance between Drones:** The distance between the drones is not always constant, especially as they move upwards.
* **Completeness of Trajectories:** In some cases, the drones don't complete the full number of loops required for a double conical helix. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Synchronization:** Ensure that both drones start and complete their trajectories simultaneously.
* **Cone Size and Alignment:** Adjust the horizontal and vertical velocities of the drones to create cones of equal size and orientation, and ensure they are aligned properly. 
* **Distance Between Drones:** Modify the pitch and angular velocity of the drones to maintain a constant distance between them throughout the flight path.
* **Completeness of Trajectories:** Ensure that both drones complete the required number of loops for a complete double conical helix.

**Overall Score:**

Based on the provided feedback, it's difficult to determine a precise "previous score" without access to the specific numerical values. However, we can analyze the general consensus:

* **Previous Score:**  The previous feedback suggests that the trajectories were close to meeting the requirements, with scores ranging from 55/100 to 70/100. 
* **Current Score:** The provided feedback indicates a range of scores from 20/100 to 70/100.

**Score Improvement:** 

**It is impossible to determine if the score has improved or worsened without the exact numerical values of the previous scores.** We can only conclude that the quality of the trajectories is inconsistent based on the different critiques.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics indicates that the trajectories are still not valid, but there is some improvement. 

**Common Issues:**

* **Conical Helix:** While the drones are forming a helical path, they are not forming a conical helix. The helices are more cylindrical than conical, and the cones are not identical in size and orientation.
* **Distance between Drones:** The distance between the drones is not constant, which is contributing to the inconsistent cone size and orientation.
* **Horizontal Velocity:** The drones are not maintaining a constant horizontal velocity, leading to a changing spiral angle and helix pitch.
* **Synchronization:**  The drones appear to be synchronized but have issues with the consistency of the parameters.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Conical Helix:** Adjust the horizontal velocity of the drones to increase proportionally with the height, which will create a conical spiral.
* **Constant Distance:**  Adjust the starting positions or horizontal velocities of the drones to maintain a consistent distance between their paths.
* **Constant Movement Parameters:** Ensure a constant horizontal velocity, leading to a constant spiral angle and helix pitch.

**Overall Score:**

* **Previous Score:** The previous feedback suggests a range of scores from 55/100 to 70/100, indicating that the trajectories were closer to meeting the requirements.
* **Current Score:** The current feedback indicates a range of scores from 20/100 to 70/100.

**Score Improvement:** 

**WORSE**

The feedback suggests that the trajectories have **worsened** since the last assessment. While some aspects have improved, the overall quality has decreased due to the inconsistency in the scores provided by different critics. This indicates that the adjustments made have not addressed all the issues effectively, and further refinement is required.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories are still not valid and do not meet the requirements for a double conical helix. While there are some improvements compared to the previous attempt, the overall quality has decreased.

**Common Issues:**

* **Conical Helix:** The drones are not forming true conical helices, with issues in cone symmetry and size.
* **Synchronization:** The drones are not consistently synchronized, resulting in uneven spacing between their paths.
* **Horizontal Velocity:** The horizontal velocity is not constant, leading to inconsistencies in the helix pitch and spiral angle.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Conical Helix:** Adjust the horizontal velocity to increase proportionally with the height to create a true conical helix.
* **Synchronization:** Ensure both drones start and finish at the same time, maintaining a constant distance between their paths.
* **Horizontal Velocity:** Maintain a consistent horizontal velocity to ensure a constant spiral angle and helix pitch.

**Overall Score:**

* **Previous Score:** The previous feedback suggests a range of scores from 55/100 to 70/100.
* **Current Score:** The current feedback indicates a range of scores from 20/100 to 70/100.

**Score Improvement:**

**WORSE** 

The overall score has **worsened** since the previous assessment, as indicated by the lower scores given by several critics. The improvements made have not been enough to address all the issues effectively, and further refinement is needed.
