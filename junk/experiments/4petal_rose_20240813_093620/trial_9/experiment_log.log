 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 4-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The user wants to create a visually appealing formation with 4 drones, each tracing a petal of a 4-petal rose curve. The drones need to coordinate their movements to ensure a smooth and continuous curve.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 4
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should start in a square formation, centered around the origin of the rose curve. Each drone should be positioned at a corner of the square, equally spaced.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will follow a path corresponding to one petal of the rose curve. The overall trajectory forms a 4-petal rose curve. To ensure a smooth and continuous curve, the following must be met:
    - Each drone must start its path at its starting corner and trace its petal in a clockwise direction.
    - The drones should maintain a constant speed throughout the flight path.
    - The timing of each drone's movement should be synchronized, such that the transition between petals is seamless. This can be achieved by adjusting the speed of each drone relative to its petal's size and curvature.
    - The endpoints of each petal should seamlessly connect to the starting point of the next petal, ensuring a continuous loop. 
[REQ] Duration: The drones should fly for a predetermined duration to complete the full rose curve. This duration should be calculated based on the speed and the distance of the flight path.
[REQ] Altitude: The drones should fly at a consistent altitude throughout the flight. This altitude should be high enough to ensure safe clearance from any obstacles.
[REQ] Formation type: The drones will be in a "sequential" formation, where each drone follows its individual trajectory without forming a specific geometric shape throughout the flight.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The critics generally agree that the drone trajectories are close to meeting the requirements but have some issues. The most common points of criticism are:

* **Gaps between petals:**  Several critics pointed out that the petals of the rose curve don't connect seamlessly, creating gaps in the overall shape. This is the most significant issue to address. 
* **Synchronization:**  There's a lack of synchronization between the drones, leading to a disjointed flow in the overall trajectory. Critics suggested adjusting the speed of each drone based on the size and curvature of their petals.

**Overall Consensus:** 

The feedback suggests that the trajectories are promising but need some adjustments to achieve a complete and visually appealing 4-petal rose curve.  

**Score:**

* **Previous Score:** 70/100
* **Current Score:** 60/100

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics are in agreement that the drone trajectories are not valid.  The main problem is that the drones do not form a complete 4-petal rose curve. 

* **Rose Curve:** The drones' paths do not follow the equation of a 4-petal rose curve. 
* **Continuity:** The paths are not continuous. Some drones do not return to their starting points, and some do not complete full petals. 
* **Synchronization:** There is a lack of synchronization, leading to a disjointed flow. 

**Overall Consensus:**

The feedback indicates that the trajectories are significantly flawed and require extensive revision to achieve the desired 4-petal rose curve.

The critics are mostly in agreement that the drone trajectories are not valid. The main issues are the lack of a complete 4-petal rose curve, the missing petals, and the inaccurate positioning. 

* **Rose Curve:** The drones' paths do not form the shape of a complete 4-petal rose curve. Some drones do not complete their respective petals, resulting in an incomplete formation. 
* **Continuity:** The drone paths may be continuous, but they do not form a closed loop, as some drones do not return to their starting points.

Feedback Summary:

The critics are largely in agreement that the drone trajectories still need significant improvement. The overall shape formed by the drones does not resemble a 4-petal rose curve, as many drones do not complete their petals or are not synchronized in their movements. 

Here are the main points of criticism:

* **Incomplete Rose Curve:** The drones do not form a complete 4-petal rose curve.  Some drones only trace partial petals, while others fail to return to their starting point, resulting in a disjointed appearance. 
* **Synchronization Issues:** The drones are not coordinated in their movements, leading to a lack of smooth transitions between petals. 
* **Starting Positions:** While some drones are positioned correctly, others are not starting at the corners of the square, further contributing to the formation issues. 
* **Continuity:**  Some drones have abrupt changes in their paths, leading to a lack of smooth curves.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics generally agree that the drone trajectories have not improved since the last evaluation. The most common issues are:

* **Incomplete Petals:** Many drones still fail to complete a full petal of the 4-petal rose curve, creating an incomplete and disjointed visual.
* **Synchronization Issues:** The movements of the drones are not coordinated, leading to uneven transitions between petals.
* **Starting Position:** The drones are not positioned in a square formation, further hindering the formation of the desired shape. 
* **Trajectory Continuity:** Some drones exhibit abrupt changes in their paths, resulting in a lack of smoothness.

**Overall Consensus:**

The critics unanimously agree that significant revisions are needed to the drone trajectories to achieve a visually appealing and accurate 4-petal rose curve.

**Score:**

* **Previous Score:** 70/100
* **Current Score:** 26/100
* **Score Change:** -44
* **Verdict:** WORSE
