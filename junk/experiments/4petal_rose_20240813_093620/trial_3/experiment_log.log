 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 4-Petal Rose Curve

This command aims to create a visually appealing, continuous rose curve using four drones, with each drone tracing a single petal. This requires coordinated movement and timing to ensure a smooth, unified curve. 

Here are the structured requirements:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 4

**[REQ] Starting formation:**  The drones should start in a square formation, centered at the origin of the rose curve. This provides a balanced starting point for each drone to begin tracing its petal.

**[REQ] Flight path:** 
* Each drone should trace a single petal of the 4-petal rose curve.
* The petals should be symmetrically arranged around the center point.
*  The drones' trajectories should be synchronized to ensure a continuous, smooth curve.  This requires defining a function (e.g., polar equation) that governs the petal's shape and using it to calculate each drone's position at any given time.
* The drones' flight speeds should be adjusted to maintain smooth transitions between petals, avoiding sudden changes in direction or speed.

**[REQ] Additional Notes:**
* This requirement focuses on the trajectory generation and assumes a suitable control system can interpret and execute the generated waypoints. 
*  It doesn't specify a specific rose curve equation. This can be adapted based on desired size and complexity. 
*  This task assumes a drone's capabilities for following pre-programmed paths.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics reveals a consistent issue: the plot only shows a single drone completing the 4-petal rose curve, while the requirement is for four drones each tracing a single petal. 

**Common Points:**

* **Missing Drones:** All critics highlight the absence of the three remaining drones, emphasizing the incompleteness of the plot.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The lack of movement from three drones makes it impossible to assess their starting positions, which are crucial for forming the initial square formation.
* **Synchronization Needed:**  Critics emphasize the need for synchronization between the drones to ensure a smooth and continuous 4-petal rose curve.

**Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the plot is currently invalid, failing to meet the requirements for a 4-petal rose curve formed by four synchronized drones. Critics consistently recommend generating trajectories for all four drones, synchronizing their movement, and using a suitable polar equation for the rose curve.

**Score Analysis:**

* **Previous Score:** The previous score was **0/100**.
* **Current Score:** The current score is **20/100**.
* **Score Change:** **BETTER** 

The score has improved significantly, indicating progress towards fulfilling the requirements. While the plot still needs further development, the recognition of a single drone successfully tracing a 4-petal rose curve marks a positive step.

 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback from the critics shows a consistent issue: the drones are not forming a 4-petal rose curve as required. While the individual drone paths are continuous, the overall shape is incorrect, and the drones are not properly synchronized. Additionally, the starting positions of the drones do not meet the requirement of forming a square formation.

**Common Points:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:**  All critics agree that the drones are not tracing the desired 4-petal rose curve. The current paths are too circular.
* **Missing Synchronization:** There is a lack of coordination between the drones, resulting in a discontinuous and disjointed overall shape.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones do not start in a square formation centered at the origin, as required.

**Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the current trajectories are invalid and require significant improvement. Critics suggest using a polar equation for a 4-petal rose curve to define the drone paths and ensuring proper synchronization of their movements. They also emphasize the importance of adjusting the starting positions to form the required square formation.

**Score Analysis:**

* **Previous Score:** 0/100 
* **Current Score:** 20/100
* **Score Change:** **BETTER** 

The score has improved, indicating progress towards fulfilling the requirements. While the plot still needs significant work, the recognition of a single drone successfully tracing a 4-petal rose curve is a positive step.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback from the critics indicates that the provided trajectory plot for the drones is still not meeting the requirements.  While there is some improvement in the current attempt, the main issue of forming a 4-petal rose curve persists.

**Common Points:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:** The drones are still forming a 6-petal rose curve instead of the required 4-petal curve.
* **Starting Formation Issues:** The drones' starting positions are not properly aligned with the required square formation centered at the origin.
* **Synchronization:** Although this is not explicitly mentioned in all feedback, the need for proper coordination and synchronization between drones for a continuous and smooth curve remains a key concern.

**Consensus:**

The general consensus is that the trajectory plot still needs significant improvement.  While some individual drone paths may be continuous, the overall shape is incorrect.  The critics consistently highlight the need for a revised trajectory that utilizes a polar equation for a 4-petal rose curve, along with precise starting positions and synchronization between drones.

**Score Analysis:**

* **Previous Score:** 0/100
* **Current Score:** 30/100
* **Score Change:** **BETTER**

The score has significantly improved from the previous attempt. This improvement is likely due to a single drone successfully tracing a 4-petal rose curve, even if the other drones are not following the correct path.  However, the trajectory plot still requires substantial adjustments to meet all the requirements.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
## Feedback Summary:

The feedback from the critics shows some improvement in the drone trajectory, but the overall shape still doesn't meet the requirements.

**Common Points:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:** The drones are still not forming a 4-petal rose curve. While some individual paths are good, the overall shape remains inaccurate.
* **Starting Formation Issues:** The drones' starting positions are not aligned to form a perfect square at the origin. 
* **Synchronization:** While most feedback doesn't explicitly mention it, there is a concern for maintaining synchronized movements for a smooth curve. 

**Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectory requires significant revisions. The 4-petal rose curve needs to be accurate, and the starting positions must form a perfect square at the origin. Additionally, the drones need to be synchronized for a smooth curve. 

**Score Analysis:**

* **Previous Score:** 25/100
* **Current Score:** 30/100
* **Score Change:** **BETTER**

While the score has improved, it is still quite low. This improvement might be due to some drones tracing a more accurate petal or a slight improvement in the starting position. However, the overall shape still doesn't meet the requirements, and substantial improvements are needed.
