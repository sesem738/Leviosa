 ## Requirements for Drone Trajectory: 4-Petal Rose Curve

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 4

**[REQ] Starting formation:** The drones should be positioned at the 4 cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) equidistant from the center point of the rose curve, forming a square.

**[REQ] Flight path:** 

* Each drone should trace a single petal of the 4-petal rose curve.
* The drones should maintain a synchronized flight pattern, ensuring the petals are continuous and form a smooth curve.
* The curve should be defined by the polar equation: r = a*sin(2θ), where 'a' is the desired radius of the rose curve and θ ranges from 0 to 2π.
* Each drone should have a distinct range of θ values corresponding to one petal of the rose curve:
    * Drone 1: 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2
    * Drone 2: π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π
    * Drone 3: π ≤ θ ≤ 3π/2
    * Drone 4: 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 2π
* The drones should adjust their speed to maintain a constant distance from each other and ensure a smooth transition between petals.

**[REQ] Ending formation:** The drones should end their trajectory at the same point they started (the 4 cardinal directions) and maintain their equidistant formation.

**[REQ] Additional considerations:**

* The drone control system should ensure smooth transitions between individual drone trajectories, creating a continuous and visually appealing rose curve.
* The system should allow for the adjustment of the radius 'a' to control the size of the rose curve.
* The trajectory should be generated offline for initial planning and then sent to the drones for execution.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback from the critics highlights several common issues with the drone trajectories:

* **Incomplete Trajectories:** The drones are not tracing a complete 4-petal rose curve. They are often missing portions of the petals or forming incomplete loops.
* **Synchronization Issues:** The drones are not synchronized, meaning they are not moving in a coordinated manner. This results in a disjointed and uneven final shape. 
* **Incorrect Overall Shape:** Despite the continuous paths, the overall shape formed by the drones' trajectories does not match the desired 4-petal rose curve.  

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Adjust Trajectory Equations:** The drones' θ values need to be correctly set to ensure each drone traces only a single petal of the rose curve. 
* **Synchronize Drones:** The drones need to maintain synchronized flight patterns, potentially by setting the same speed for all drones and ensuring their angular velocities are coordinated.
* **Verify Correctness:** Double-check that the drones are accurately following the provided polar equation for a 4-petal rose curve (r = a*sin(2θ)).

Based on the feedback, the previous score was **40/100**. 

The current score is **60/100**. 

The score has improved by **+20**. **BETTER**

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback indicates that the drone trajectories have improved significantly. Here's a summary of the consensus:

**Common Improvements:**

* **Continuity:** The drones now maintain continuous and smooth paths, addressing a major concern from previous feedback.
* **Completeness:** While not fully complete, the drones now trace a single petal each, showing progress towards forming the complete rose curve.
* **Synchronization:** There is a general acknowledgement that the drones are closer to synchronized movement, contributing to a more visually appealing shape.

**Remaining Issues:**

* **Overall Shape:** The overall shape of the rose curve is not yet perfect. While the 4-petal shape is visible, the petals are not continuous and lack a smooth transition, indicating a need for further adjustments.
* **Speed Control:**  The need for more precise speed control to maintain constant distance between drones and smooth transitions is still highlighted.

**Overall Consensus:**

The trajectory generation is improving, but there are still some key areas that need more work to achieve a perfect 4-petal rose curve.  The progress is significant, though, and the critics are encouraged by the improvements.

**Scores:**

* **Previous Score:** 40/100
* **Current Score:** 60/100

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback highlights a significant improvement in the drone trajectories. While some issues remain, the critics are generally positive about the progress.

**Common Improvements:**

* **Continuity:** All drones now have smooth and continuous paths.
* **Completeness:**  Each drone now traces a complete petal, showcasing a greater understanding of the requirement for a full 4-petal rose curve. 
* **Starting Positions:**  The drones are now correctly positioned at the four cardinal directions, forming a square as required.

**Remaining Issues:**

* **Overall Shape:** Although the 4-petal shape is visible, it is not perfectly formed. The transition between petals still needs refinement, and the curve isn't completely smooth.
* **Speed Control:** Some critics note that the drones' speed needs further adjustments to maintain a constant distance between each other and achieve smoother transitions between petals.

**Overall Consensus:**

The critics agree that the trajectories are much better, with noticeable improvements in continuity, completeness, and starting positions.  However, there is a need for further refinement of the overall shape and speed control to achieve a perfect 4-petal rose curve. 

**Scores:**

* **Previous Score:** 40/100 
* **Current Score:** 70/100

**Improvement:** +30. **BETTER**
