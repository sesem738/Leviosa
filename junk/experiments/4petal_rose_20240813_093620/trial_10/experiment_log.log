 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 4-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The user desires a visual pattern created by four drones flying in a synchronized formation, each tracing a petal of a four-petaled rose curve. The emphasis is on smooth, continuous movement, suggesting coordinated flight paths.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] **Number of drones:** 4

[REQ] **Starting formation:** The drones should begin in a square formation, centered around the origin of the rose curve. Each drone occupies a corner of the square, facing towards the center.

[REQ] **Flight path:** Each drone will trace a single petal of the four-petaled rose curve. The curve is defined by the polar equation: r = a * sin(2 * theta), where 'a' is the radius of the rose and 'theta' is the angle in radians.  

  * **Parameterization:** The drones will move along the curve parameterized by time 't'. Let 't' range from 0 to 2*pi. 
  * **Individual drone paths:** Each drone will cover a specific range of theta values, with each range spanning pi/2 radians:
    * Drone 1: 0 <= theta <= pi/2
    * Drone 2: pi/2 <= theta <= pi
    * Drone 3: pi <= theta <= 3*pi/2
    * Drone 4: 3*pi/2 <= theta <= 2*pi
  * **Coordination:** To ensure a smooth and continuous curve, each drone should start flying at the same time 't=0' and reach the endpoint of its petal at the same time 't=2*pi'. 
  * **Synchronization:**  The drones' velocities should be coordinated to ensure that they smoothly transition between each petal section. This can be achieved by using a time-dependent speed profile that ensures continuous movement along the curve.

[REQ] **Final formation:** The drones will end their flight in the same square formation they started in, with each drone returning to its original corner position.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback is overwhelmingly negative. The trajectories are significantly flawed and do not meet the requirements for a four-petaled rose curve. 

Here's a summary of the common issues:

* **Starting Positions:** The drones consistently fail to start in the required square formation. They are either starting at the origin or not facing the correct direction. 
* **Petal Completeness:** While some critics note the drones are tracing petal-like shapes, the overall shape is not a proper rose curve. The petals are either not fully formed or not positioned correctly.
* **Final Formation:** The drones are not returning to their original square formation. 

**Overall, the feedback is consistent: the trajectories are not valid and require significant improvements.**

Based on the feedback, it's impossible to determine a previous score.  However, the current score is 20/100.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The previous feedback indicated that the trajectories were **MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)**, meaning that none of the critics found them acceptable. 

The current feedback reveals a **consensus that the trajectories are still not valid**, but there is some improvement. Critics are finding some elements of the trajectories acceptable, like continuity and absence of collisions, but significant issues remain with the overall shape, starting positions, and final formations. 

The previous score was **0/100**, and the current score is **20/100**. 

Therefore, the score has **improved** by **+20**. 

This is a modest improvement, indicating that the revised trajectories have addressed some of the critical issues, but they still require further adjustments to meet all the requirements.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The previous feedback indicated that the trajectories were **MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)**, meaning that none of the critics found them acceptable. 

The current feedback reveals a **consensus that the trajectories are still not valid**, but there is some improvement. Critics are finding some elements of the trajectories acceptable, like continuity and absence of collisions, but significant issues remain with the overall shape, starting positions, and final formations. 

The previous score was **0/100**, and the current score is **40/100**. 

Therefore, the score has **improved** by **+40**. 

This is a significant improvement, indicating that the revised trajectories have addressed some of the critical issues, but they still require further adjustments to meet all the requirements.
