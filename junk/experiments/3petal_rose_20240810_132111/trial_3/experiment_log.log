 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 3-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The user wants to generate a 3-petal rose curve using 3 drones, with each drone tracing out a single petal. The drones should coordinate their movements to create a seamless, continuous rose pattern.

Here are the detailed requirements:

[REQ] Number of drones: 3 
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should be positioned at the origin (0,0) with equal angular separation of 120 degrees. This ensures a balanced and symmetrical starting point for the formation.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will follow a parameterized curve representing one petal of a 3-petal rose. The general parametric equation for a rose curve is: 

x = a * cos(t) * sin(n*t) 
y = a * sin(t) * sin(n*t)

Where:
* `a` is the radius of the rose 
* `t` is the parameter, representing time 
* `n` is the number of petals

For a 3-petal rose, each drone will use the above equation with `n=3`. Each drone will have a unique starting angle offset in the `t` parameter to ensure each drone traces a different petal. For example, drone 1 could start at `t = 0`, drone 2 at `t = 2π/3`, and drone 3 at `t = 4π/3`.
[REQ] Coordination: The drones should synchronize their movements to ensure a seamless flow and continuity between the petals. This can be achieved by coordinating the `t` parameter for each drone, ensuring a smooth transition between the individual petal trajectories.
[REQ] Flight pattern: The drones should move along their respective petal paths in a coordinated manner, maintaining a constant speed and ensuring a smooth transition from one petal to the next. The overall flight path should resemble a 3-petal rose shape with each drone covering a complete petal.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the trajectory plot is **significantly flawed**.  It fails to meet the requirement of having three drones each tracing a petal of a 3-petal rose curve.  

* **Previous Score:** 0/100 
* **Current Score:** 0/100 

**WORSE**  

The provided plot is worse than the initial submission, since it doesn't even attempt to produce the three-petal rose curve.  It only shows one drone in a straight line.
