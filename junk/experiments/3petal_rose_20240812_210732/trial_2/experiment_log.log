 ## Requirements for 3-Petal Rose Curve Drone Formation:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 3 

**[REQ] Starting formation:**  The drones should begin in an equilateral triangle formation centered at the origin of the desired rose curve. This ensures an even distribution for petal generation.

**[REQ] Flight path:** 
* **Individual drone trajectory:** Each drone will follow a modified sinusoidal path, tracing out a single petal of the rose curve. The path should be parameterized by time, with the drone's position defined by a function incorporating sine and cosine components.  
* **Coordination:**  The drones must synchronize their movements to ensure a seamless, continuous rose pattern.  This synchronization can be achieved by adjusting the phase shift in each drone's sinusoidal path. 
* **Petal shape:** The drone paths should be adjusted to create a 3-petal rose curve.  This likely requires adjusting the frequency and amplitude of the sinusoidal functions used for each drone's trajectory. 

**[REQ]  Desired end state:** After completing the rose curve, the drones should return to their initial equilateral triangle formation, maintaining a stable position.

# [REQ] Flight path:  Individual drone trajectory - Modified sinusoidal path
# Define the frequency of the sinusoidal path
frequency = 3
# Define the amplitude of the sinusoidal path
amplitude = 1

# [REQ] Flight path:  Coordination - Adjust phase shift for each drone
# Calculate the phase shift for each drone
phase_shift = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, num_drones, endpoint=False)

# [REQ] Flight path: Petal shape - Adjust frequency and amplitude for 3-petal rose
# The number of petals in a rose curve is determined by the frequency.
# Since we want 3 petals, we keep the frequency as 3.
# The amplitude controls the size of the rose curve.
# For this particular rose curve, the amplitude is 1.

# [REQ] Desired end state: Return to initial equilateral triangle formation
# To achieve this, we need to add a return path after the rose curve.
# The return path can be achieved by reversing the trajectories.

# Generate the waypoints for each drone
waypoints = []

    # Calculate the x and y coordinates of the drone's trajectory
