 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Double Helix

**Interpretation:** The command requests a synchronized, double helix flight path with two drones, each forming a separate strand of the helix.  

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation:  The two drones should be positioned at the base of the helix, side-by-side and facing in the same direction, with a slight horizontal offset to allow for the helix formation. 
[REQ] Flight path: 
    - Each drone will follow a helical path, ascending in a spiral motion around a central axis.
    - The two helix strands should be parallel, with a constant horizontal distance between them.
    - The drones should maintain synchronized movement, meaning they ascend at the same rate and complete each helix turn simultaneously.
    - The helix should have a constant pitch (vertical distance between each turn), and a constant radius for each strand.
[REQ] Drone movement:  Both drones should maintain a constant velocity and altitude throughout the flight. 
[REQ] Synchronization:  The drone control system must ensure the drones maintain synchronized movement to form the double helix pattern. This can be achieved by coordinating their velocity, heading, and altitude adjustments.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The overall consensus from the critics is that the trajectories are close to meeting the requirements for a double helix, but they need significant improvement.  While the trajectories are continuous and there are no collisions, the drones are not properly synchronized, the helixes are not parallel, and the overall shape does not form a true double helix.  

Here's a breakdown of the common points:

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Synchronization:** The drones need to ascend at the same rate and complete each turn of the helix simultaneously.
* **Parallelism:** The helixes need to maintain a constant distance between each other and remain perfectly parallel. 
* **Constant Pitch and Radius:** The trajectories should have a consistent vertical distance between turns (pitch) and a constant radius for each helix strand.
* **Starting Positions:** The drones need to be positioned at the base of the helix, side-by-side and facing the same direction, with a sufficient horizontal offset to create distinct helix strands.

**Scores:**

* **Previous Score:** 65/100
* **Current Score:** 10/100
* **Score Change:** -55 - WORSE

The consensus among the critics is that the trajectory plot shows a good attempt at a double helix, but still has several issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements. While the paths are continuous and there are no collisions, the lack of synchronization, the non-parallel helixes, and the deviation from a true double helix shape remain significant problems.

Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that the trajectory plot is showing improvement towards a double helix, but still has issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements. There are some improvements in synchronization and the helix shape but further adjustments are required. 

Here's a breakdown of the common points:

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Synchronization:** The drones need to ascend at the same rate and complete each helix turn simultaneously. There are still discrepancies in the ascending rate and loop completion times.
* **Parallelism:** The helixes need to maintain a constant distance between each other and remain perfectly parallel.  Although there is some improvement, the helixes are not completely parallel.
* **Constant Pitch and Radius:** The trajectories should have a consistent vertical distance between turns (pitch) and a constant radius for each helix strand. The pitch and radius still vary throughout the trajectory, leading to a distorted helix shape.
* **Starting Positions:** The drones need to be positioned at the base of the helix, side-by-side and facing the same direction, with a sufficient horizontal offset to create distinct helix strands. While the starting positions are better than before, they are not yet perfectly positioned at the helix base.

* **Current Score:** 40/100
