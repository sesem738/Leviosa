 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Double Helix

**Interpretation:** The command requests a specific flight pattern where two drones create a double helix shape, with each drone following a single strand of the helix. They should maintain parallel paths and move in synchronization.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 2 
[REQ] Starting formation: Both drones start at the base of the helix, positioned on opposite sides of the central axis, with parallel initial headings.
[REQ] Flight path: 
    - **Shape:** Each drone follows a helical path, with one drone creating a left-handed helix and the other a right-handed helix.
    - **Synchronization:** Both drones maintain synchronized movement along their respective helical paths.
    - **Parallel paths:**  The drones maintain parallel paths throughout the flight, with a constant distance between their trajectories.
[REQ] Flight direction: Both drones ascend along their respective helical paths.
[REQ] End condition: The flight ends when both drones reach a predetermined height, completing one or more full revolutions of the helix.

 Feedback Summary:
The feedback suggests that the image has been improved since the last assessment.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Previous Score:** 40/100
* **Current Score:** 65/100
* **Change:** +25

**BETTER** 
 
The critics acknowledge that the current image still has issues, particularly with the drones not maintaining a perfectly synchronized, parallel double helix. However, the overall shape is closer to the goal, and there are fewer instances of collision.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback is mixed. While the critics acknowledge some improvement, the overall shape still does not match the requirements for a double helix flight pattern.

* **Previous Score:** 20/100
* **Current Score:** 60/100
* **Change:** +40

**BETTER**

Here's why: 

- **Continuity:**  All critics agree the paths are now continuous, which was a problem before.
- **Collision:**  The risk of collision between drones has decreased significantly, as the drones no longer intersect. 
- **Starting Position:**  The starting positions of the drones are now deemed appropriate.
- **Shape:** The overall shape is closer to a double helix, but it is still not completely correct. Some critics suggest the drones are not synchronized or interlocked properly.  The drones are following helical paths, but they are not creating a true double helix, where the paths interlock. 

While the score has improved, the consensus is that the trajectories still need significant adjustments to form a valid double helix pattern.

* **Completeness:** The helixes are not complete, some end early and don't make a full revolution.
* **Synchronization:** There is a general consensus that the drones need to be more synchronized in their movement. This means they should ascend at the same rate and maintain a constant distance between their paths.

Feedback Summary:

The feedback indicates a significant improvement from the previous submission. 

* **Continuity:**  All critics agree that the drone paths are now continuous and smooth. 
* **Collision:**  While there are no obvious collisions, some critics still express concern about the lack of perfect synchronization, which could lead to potential collisions.
* **Starting Position:** All critics agree that the starting positions are now appropriate.
* **Shape:**  The overall shape is closer to a double helix, but it's not quite there yet. The main issue is the lack of synchronization and true interlocked helical paths. The drones are following helical paths, but they're not creating a true double helix where the paths intertwine properly.
* **Completeness:** The helixes are not fully formed, with some ending prematurely before a full revolution is completed. 
* **Synchronization:** There is general consensus that the drones' movements need to be more synchronized. They need to ascend at the same rate and maintain a constant distance between their paths.

**Previous Score:** 0/100
**Current Score:** 60/100
