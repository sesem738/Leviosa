 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Double Helix

This prompt describes a synchronized flight pattern with two drones, each tracing one strand of a double helix. Here's a breakdown of the requirements:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should start at the base of the helix, positioned on opposite sides of the central axis. This ensures each drone begins its ascent along a separate helix strand. 
[REQ] Flight path: 
    - Each drone will follow a helical path, ascending along a spiral trajectory.
    - The helix should have a consistent radius and pitch. 
    - The drones maintain parallel paths, meaning they ascend at the same rate and maintain a constant horizontal distance from each other.
    - The drones should move in synchronization, meaning their movements should be coordinated to ensure they maintain their parallel paths and ascent rate. 
[REQ] Drone movement:
    - The drones should maintain a constant speed throughout their flight. 
    - The drones should maintain a consistent altitude differential, ensuring that they do not collide. 
[REQ] Trajectory shape: The overall trajectory should resemble a double helix, with each drone tracing a single helix strand. 

This set of requirements ensures the creation of a double helix trajectory using two drones.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback suggests the following:

**Common Points:**

* **The most critical issue is that the drones are not following a double helix trajectory.** They are either moving in circles, or their ascent is not synchronized, resulting in a shape that doesn't resemble a double helix.
* **The starting positions of the drones are generally considered appropriate.** 
* **The continuity of each drone's path is generally satisfactory.**

**Overall Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectories are not valid. They fail to meet the most critical requirement of forming a double helix. 

**Scores:**

* **Previous Score:**  The previous score is **20/100**.
* **Current Score:** The current score is **40/100**.

**Score Improvement:**  **BETTER**

Feedback Summary:

**Common Points:**

* **The trajectories are not a valid double helix.** The drones fail to maintain the required helical shape, either moving in circular paths or not ascending in a synchronized manner.

* **The starting positions of the drones are generally considered appropriate.** Most critics agree that the starting positions are correct, though some suggest minor adjustments.
* **The continuity of the paths is satisfactory.** There are no breaks or sudden jumps in the trajectories.

**Overall Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectories are not valid and do not meet the requirements for a double helix. While the starting positions are generally considered correct, the drones need to follow a complete and accurate helical path.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

**Common Points:**

* **The trajectories do not form a double helix.** All critics agree that the drones' paths do not follow a helical trajectory, instead forming circles, ellipses, or other shapes.
* **The drones do not maintain a consistent distance from each other.** This leads to potential collisions and prevents the creation of a distinct double helix shape.
* **The drones do not ascend at a consistent rate.**  The lack of synchronization between the drones results in a distorted, non-uniform double helix.
* **The drones do not complete the required helical trajectory.**  The drones often stop short of completing a full helix, further contributing to the invalid trajectory.
* **The starting positions are generally acceptable.** Most critics agree that the starting positions are appropriate, though there are some suggestions for minor adjustments.

**Overall Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectories are not valid and do not meet the requirements for a double helix. The drones fail to follow a helical path, maintain a constant distance from each other, and ascend at a consistent rate. While the starting positions are generally deemed acceptable, the overall shape formed by the trajectories is significantly flawed.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

**Common Points:**

* **The trajectories do not form a double helix.** All critics agree that the drones' paths do not follow a helical trajectory, instead forming circles, ellipses, or other shapes.
* **The drones do not maintain a consistent distance from each other.** This leads to potential collisions and prevents the creation of a distinct double helix shape.
* **The drones do not ascend at a consistent rate.**  The lack of synchronization between the drones results in a distorted, non-uniform double helix.
* **The drones do not complete the required helical trajectory.**  The drones often stop short of completing a full helix, further contributing to the invalid trajectory.
* **The starting positions are generally acceptable.** Most critics agree that the starting positions are appropriate, though there are some suggestions for minor adjustments.

**Overall Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectories are not valid and do not meet the requirements for a double helix. The drones fail to follow a helical path, maintain a constant distance from each other, and ascend at a consistent rate. While the starting positions are generally deemed acceptable, the overall shape formed by the trajectories is significantly flawed.

**Scores:**

* **Previous Score:** The previous score is **20/100**.
* **Current Score:** The current score is **25/100**.

**Score Improvement:** **BETTER**

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

**Common Points:**

* **The trajectories do not form a double helix.** While the drones exhibit helical paths, they do not create the distinct double helix structure required.
* **The drones do not maintain a consistent distance from each other.** They either intersect or maintain an inconsistent distance, which negatively impacts the double helix formation. 
* **The drones do not ascend at a consistent rate.** This lack of synchronization disrupts the formation of a proper double helix.
* **The starting positions need adjustment.** The majority of critics agree that the starting positions, while somewhat appropriate, need to be fine-tuned for a proper double helix. 

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the trajectories are not valid and need significant improvement. While the drones partially exhibit helical movements, they fail to meet the crucial criteria for creating a proper double helix.

**Scores:**

* **Previous Score:** 20/100
* **Current Score:** 25/100

**Score Improvement:** BETTER
