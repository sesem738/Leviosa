 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements:

**Interpretation:** The command requests a synchronized flight pattern for two drones, creating a complete circle by each drone flying half the circumference. This implies a coordinated, symmetrical movement with both drones maintaining consistent relative positions.

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation: The two drones should start at opposite ends of a diameter of the intended circle. This ensures they begin in the correct relative positions for synchronized movement.
[REQ] Flight path: 
    - Each drone will trace a semi-circular path, with the two paths forming a complete circle. 
    - The drones should maintain a constant distance from each other, with their paths mirroring each other across the center of the circle. 
    - The drones should move at the same speed and maintain synchronization throughout the flight, ensuring they complete their respective semicircles simultaneously.
[REQ] Flight direction: The drones can either move clockwise or counter-clockwise, as long as they move in the same direction. 
[REQ] Desired shape: The complete trajectory forms a perfect circle.
[REQ] Synchronization: Both drones need to maintain consistent relative positions and complete their respective half-circles at the same time.

 MAJORITY INVALID (1/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback is mixed. While all critics agree that the trajectories are not valid because they do not form a complete circle, there is some disagreement about how close the current trajectories are to meeting the requirements.

**Common Points:**

* **Incorrect Trajectories:** All critics agree that the trajectories are incorrect because they do not form a complete circle. 
* **Drone 1:**  All critics agree that Drone 1's trajectory is a successful semicircle. 
* **Drone 2:** All critics agree that Drone 2's trajectory is the problem. It does not form a semicircle. 
* **Starting Positions:** All critics agree that the drones start at the correct positions.
* **Synchronization:** Some critics note that the drones are not synchronized, while others do not comment on it. 

**Overall Consensus:**

The consensus is that the trajectories are not valid and need significant improvement. The main issue is Drone 2's trajectory, which does not form a semicircle. 

**Score:**

* **Previous Score:** 10/100 
* **Current Score:** 20/100
* **Improvement:** +10  **BETTER**

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback is mixed, but leaning towards a slight improvement in the trajectories. 

**Common Points:**

* **Incorrect Trajectories:** All critics agree that the trajectories are incorrect, primarily because they do not form a complete circle.
* **Drone 1:** Most critics agree that Drone 1's trajectory is a successful semicircle. 
* **Drone 2:** All critics agree that Drone 2's trajectory is the problem. It does not form a semicircle or in some cases, even a quarter circle. 
* **Starting Positions:** All critics agree that the drones start at the correct positions. 
* **Synchronization:** Some critics comment on the lack of synchronization, while others don't mention it explicitly.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the trajectories require significant improvement. While some progress has been made (Drone 1's trajectory being a successful semicircle),  Drone 2's trajectory remains the main obstacle.

* **Previous Score:** 10/100
