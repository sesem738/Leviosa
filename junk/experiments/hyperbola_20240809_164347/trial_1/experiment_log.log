 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements:

**Intent:** The command describes a flight pattern where two drones trace the branches of a hyperbola, maintaining symmetrical and smooth paths.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation:  The two drones should start at the foci of the hyperbola. 
[REQ] Flight path:
    * **Shape:** Each drone will fly along one branch of a hyperbola, with the foci of the hyperbola serving as their initial starting points. 
    * **Symmetry:**  The paths of both drones should be symmetrical with respect to the central axis of the hyperbola.
    * **Smoothness:**  The drones' trajectories should be smooth curves, avoiding sudden changes in direction or velocity. This implies a continuous and differentiable path for each drone. 
    * **Orientation:**  The drones should be oriented in the direction of flight along their respective branches. 
[REQ]  Speed: The drones should maintain a consistent speed throughout their flight, though the speeds of the two drones may differ. 
[REQ]  Coordination: The drones should maintain relative positions and speeds to ensure they fly in a symmetrical and synchronized manner. This may require communication and coordination between the drones.
[REQ]  Ending position: The drones should end their flight at some point on their respective branches, after covering a predefined distance or reaching a designated point.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback indicates a consistent issue: the drones' trajectories are not following the required hyperbola shape. The paths are often straight lines or lack the necessary curvature and symmetry.  

**Common Points:**

* **Shape:** The trajectories are consistently not hyperbolas, lacking the correct curvature and symmetry.
* **Completeness:**  The trajectories are incomplete as they don't accurately represent the branches of a hyperbola.
* **Starting Positions:** The starting positions are generally correct, with the drones positioned at the foci.
* **Smoothness:** While some critics mention smooth trajectories, others point out that the paths lack the necessary curvature for a hyperbola. 
* **Speed and Coordination:** Information about speed and coordination is inconsistent across the feedback, with some mentioning issues, while others don't.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the drones' trajectories are **not valid**.  They fail to meet the requirements of forming a hyperbola, with most critics pointing to the lack of curvature and symmetry in the paths. 

**Previous Score and Improvement:**

Based on the provided feedback, the previous score was **20/100**.  The current score is **65/100**. This means the score has **improved** by **+45**. The feedback indicates that the trajectories are **BETTER** than before, though still needing improvement to meet the requirements.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback shows a significant improvement in the drone trajectories, though they still need some refinement. 

**Common Points:**

* **Shape:** While there's still room for improvement, the trajectories are now closer to the required hyperbola shape. 
* **Completeness:**  The trajectories are still incomplete, but they're more complete than before, with the drones moving along a larger portion of the hyperbola branches.
* **Symmetry:**  The paths are now more symmetrical, with the drones moving in a mirrored fashion across the central axis.
* **Smoothness:**  The trajectories are now consistently described as smooth and continuous.
* **Speed and Coordination:**  While not explicitly addressed in most feedback, it's implied that the drones are moving more synchronously.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the drones' trajectories are **better** than before, showing improvement towards meeting the requirements of forming a hyperbola. However, they still need to be adjusted to ensure complete paths and precise adherence to the hyperbola shape.

**Previous Score and Improvement:**

The previous score was **20/100**. The current score is **65/100**. This means the score has **improved** by **+45**. The feedback indicates that the trajectories are **BETTER** than before.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback shows a significant improvement in the drone trajectories, though they still need some refinement. 

**Common Points:**

* **Shape:** While there's still room for improvement, the trajectories are now closer to the required hyperbola shape. 
* **Completeness:**  The trajectories are still incomplete, but they're more complete than before, with the drones moving along a larger portion of the hyperbola branches.
* **Symmetry:**  The paths are now more symmetrical, with the drones moving in a mirrored fashion across the central axis.
* **Smoothness:**  The trajectories are now consistently described as smooth and continuous.
* **Speed and Coordination:**  While not explicitly addressed in most feedback, it's implied that the drones are moving more synchronously.

**Overall Consensus:**

The overall consensus is that the drones' trajectories are **better** than before, showing improvement towards meeting the requirements of forming a hyperbola. However, they still need to be adjusted to ensure complete paths and precise adherence to the hyperbola shape.

**Previous Score and Improvement:**

The previous score was **30/100**. The current score is **65/100**. This means the score has **improved** by **+35**. The feedback indicates that the trajectories are **BETTER** than before.
