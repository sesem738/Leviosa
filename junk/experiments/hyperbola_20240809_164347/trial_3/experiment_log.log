 ## Requirements for Hyperbolic Drone Trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation: The two drones should be positioned at the foci of the intended hyperbola. This ensures symmetrical paths and minimizes initial distance.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone should trace one branch of the hyperbola. The paths should be symmetrical with respect to the central axis of the hyperbola, creating a mirror image of each other. 
[REQ] Path smoothness: The drone trajectory should be continuous and smooth, avoiding sudden changes in direction or velocity. This can be achieved by using a suitable parametric equation for the hyperbolic path.
[REQ] Symmetry: The drones should maintain a constant distance from the central axis, ensuring that their paths are mirror images of each other. This implies that the two drones should maintain a synchronized flight pattern.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback consistently highlights that the trajectories do not form a hyperbola, failing to meet the core requirement of the task.  Issues include:

* **Incorrect Path:**  The drones fly in straight lines, not hyperbolic curves.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:**  While sometimes starting at the foci of a hyperbola, the drones' subsequent movements do not follow the expected hyperbolic trajectory.
* **Lack of Symmetry:** The drone paths are not symmetrical, failing to maintain a constant distance from the central axis.

**Overall Consensus:** The critics unanimously agree that the trajectories are not valid and require significant correction to achieve a hyperbolic shape. 

**Score Analysis:**

* **Previous Score:**  20/100
* **Current Score:** 0/100 
* **Change:** -20 (WORSE) 

The score has unfortunately decreased, indicating that the provided trajectories are even further from meeting the requirements than the previous submission.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The feedback continues to highlight the fundamental flaw in the trajectories: they do not form a hyperbola. While some aspects have improved, such as smoother paths, the core issue of incorrect trajectory persists. Here's a breakdown:

* **Incorrect Path:**  The drones still don't follow hyperbolic paths, with many flying in straight lines or incorrect curves. 
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:**  Though sometimes starting near the foci, the drones often fail to maintain a consistent hyperbolic movement.
* **Symmetry Issues:** The paths lack symmetry, with drones not maintaining equal distances from the central axis.
* **Collisions:** There are still potential collisions in some submissions.

**Overall Consensus:** The critics agree that the trajectories are still invalid and far from achieving the desired hyperbolic shape. 

**Score Analysis:**

* **Previous Score:** 20/100
* **Current Score:** 10/100 
* **Change:** -10 (WORSE) 

While the score did not drop as drastically as the previous submission, it has still decreased.  This indicates the need for substantial improvements to address the core issues before meeting the requirements.

Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories are still invalid and require significant improvement. While there is some progress in terms of smooth paths and positioning the drones near the foci, the drones still fail to form a hyperbola.  

Here's a breakdown of the common issues:

* **Incorrect Path:** The drones are not flying along a hyperbolic path, often deviating into straight lines or inaccurate curves.
* **Symmetry Issues:** The trajectories lack symmetry, with the drones not maintaining a consistent distance from the central axis. 
* **Completeness:** The drones are not completing the intended hyperbolic path.
* **Collision Potential:** Some submissions still exhibit potential collisions.

**Score Analysis:**

* **Previous Score:** 20/100
* **Current Score:** 10/100
* **Change:** -10 (WORSE)
