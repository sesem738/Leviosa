 ## Requirements for Hyperbolic Drone Trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2 

[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should be positioned at the foci of the intended hyperbola. This ensures symmetrical and smooth path generation.

[REQ] Flight path:  Each drone should follow one branch of the hyperbola. The paths should be symmetrical about the vertical axis passing through the center of the hyperbola. This ensures the drones maintain a mirror-like formation throughout the flight. 

[REQ] Path constraints: The paths should be smooth, continuous, and free of sharp turns or sudden changes in direction. This ensures a graceful flight and minimizes the risk of instability or unexpected drone behavior.

[REQ] Velocity:  The drones should maintain a consistent velocity along their respective hyperbolic paths. This ensures the drones maintain formation and reach their designated points at the same time.  

[REQ] Coordination: The drones should be synchronized, maintaining a consistent relative position to each other throughout the flight. This ensures the symmetry and visual appeal of the hyperbolic formation.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are incorrect and do not meet the requirements. The primary issues are:

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:** The drones are currently moving in straight lines, not following the required hyperbolic paths.
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** The drones are not positioned at the foci of the intended hyperbola.
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** Some critics noted that the trajectories are incomplete, showing only a single branch of the hyperbola.

While some critics found aspects of the paths to be continuous and free from anomalies, the lack of proper hyperbolic shape and starting positions significantly hinders the overall effectiveness.

Based on the feedback, the previous score was likely **0/100**, as several critics explicitly gave this score. The current score is also **0/100**, indicating **NO CHANGE** in the score.

Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that the drone trajectories are still incorrect and do not meet the requirements.  While there is some improvement in that the drones now have continuous paths, the primary issues remain:

* **Incorrect Trajectory Shape:**  The drones are not following the required hyperbolic paths.  Drone 2 still has a straight line trajectory and Drone 1's trajectory does not form a proper hyperbola. 
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** The trajectories are incomplete, showing only a single branch of the hyperbola.

The critics highlighted that the starting positions are now correct, but this does not compensate for the lack of proper hyperbolic shape.
