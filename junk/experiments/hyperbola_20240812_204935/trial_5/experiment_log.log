 ## Requirements for Hyperbolic Drone Trajectory:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 2

**[REQ] Starting formation:**  The drones should be positioned at the focal points of the intended hyperbola. This ensures symmetrical paths.

**[REQ] Flight path:** 
* Each drone will follow one branch of the hyperbola.
* The two branches should be symmetrical, reflecting each other across the central axis of the hyperbola.
*  The drone trajectory must be smooth, avoiding sudden changes in direction or velocity. This can be achieved by using a continuous mathematical function to define the hyperbola's path.
* The drones should maintain a constant speed, allowing for smooth and coordinated movement along the hyperbolic path. 

**[REQ]  Symmetry:** The two branches of the hyperbola should be mirror images of each other, with the drones maintaining the same distance from the central axis throughout their flight.

**[REQ]  Smoothness:** The flight path should be smooth and continuous, without sharp corners or abrupt changes in direction. This can be achieved using a parameterized equation for the hyperbola, allowing for smooth transitions between waypoints.

 ```python

import numpy as np

# Define the hyperbola's parameters
a = 5  # Distance from the center to a vertex
b = 3  # Distance from the center to a co-vertex
c = np.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)  # Distance from the center to a focus

# Define the range of the parameter (t) for the hyperbola
t_range = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)

# Calculate the x and y coordinates for the hyperbola
x1 = a * np.cosh(t_range)  # Branch 1, drone 1
y1 = b * np.sinh(t_range)
x2 = -a * np.cosh(t_range)  # Branch 2, drone 2
y2 = b * np.sinh(t_range)

# Define the starting positions of the drones
start_position1 = [c, 0, 0]  # Drone 1 starts at the right focus
start_position2 = [-c, 0, 0]  # Drone 2 starts at the left focus

# Define the height of the trajectory (z-coordinate)
z = 2

# Create the waypoints for each drone
waypoints1 = np.array([x1, y1, np.full_like(x1, z)])
waypoints2 = np.array([x2, y2, np.full_like(x2, z)])

# Convert to a list of waypoints (x, y, z)
waypoints1 = waypoints1.T.tolist()
waypoints2 = waypoints2.T.tolist()

# Add the starting positions to the beginning of the waypoints
waypoints1.insert(0, start_position1)
waypoints2.insert(0, start_position2)

# Store the waypoints in a list for all drones
waypoints = [waypoints1, waypoints2]

2024-08-12 20:58:07,982 - INFO - Aggregated feedback from multiple critics:

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback consistently identifies several key issues:

* **Incorrect Shape:** The trajectories do not form a hyperbolic shape, often resembling a pair of parabolas or incomplete curves.
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** The paths are often cut short, failing to fully represent the intended hyperbolic shape.
* **Symmetry Issues:** The two branches of the hyperbola are frequently asymmetrical, with the drones not maintaining equal distances from the central axis.
* **Potential Collision:**  The trajectories often intersect near the origin, raising concerns about potential collisions between the drones.
* **Starting Position:** While some critics acknowledge the drones start in the correct positions, others suggest that the positions are inaccurate or not conducive to symmetrical trajectories.

**Overall Consensus:** The overall consensus is that the provided trajectories are not valid.  There is a clear need for significant improvements to ensure the paths accurately form a hyperbolic shape, maintain symmetry, avoid collisions, and are complete.

**Previous Score:** The previous feedback did not include a score. 

**Current Score:** The feedback indicates an average score of around **30/100**. 

**Score Change:** Since there's no previous score, we cannot determine improvement or decline.
