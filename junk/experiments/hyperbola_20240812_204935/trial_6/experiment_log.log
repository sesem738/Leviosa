 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: Hyperbolic Path

Here's the breakdown of requirements based on the given command:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 2

**[REQ] Starting positions:**  The two drones should be positioned at the foci of the intended hyperbola. This will ensure a symmetrical and smooth path.

**[REQ] Flight path:**

* Each drone will trace one branch of the hyperbola.
* The drones will maintain symmetrical paths with respect to the axis of symmetry of the hyperbola.
* The flight path should be smooth and continuous, avoiding any sharp turns or abrupt changes in velocity.
* The trajectory should be designed to ensure that the drones maintain a safe distance from each other throughout the flight.

**[REQ] Additional considerations:**

* The control system should be able to calculate the exact hyperbola equation based on the desired shape and dimensions.
* The system should be able to accurately translate the hyperbola equation into individual waypoint trajectories for each drone.
* The system should provide feedback on the drone's progress along the path and adjust the trajectory as needed to maintain symmetry and smoothness.

This set of requirements ensures that the drones will execute a hyperbolic trajectory, maintaining symmetry, smoothness, and safety throughout the flight.

 ```python
import numpy as np

# Define hyperbola parameters
a = 5  # Semi-major axis
b = 3  # Semi-minor axis
c = np.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)  # Distance from center to focus

# Calculate foci positions
focus1 = [-c, 0]
focus2 = [c, 0]

# Define the range of the parameter 't'
t = np.linspace(-5, 5, 50)

# Calculate waypoints for each drone
waypoints1 = [(a * np.cosh(t), b * np.sinh(t)) for t in t]
waypoints2 = [(-a * np.cosh(t), b * np.sinh(t)) for t in t]

# Convert waypoints to 3D coordinates (assuming z = 0)
waypoints1 = [[x, y, 0] for x, y in waypoints1]
waypoints2 = [[x, y, 0] for x, y in waypoints2]

# Group waypoints for both drones
waypoints = [waypoints1, waypoints2]

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback consistently identifies that the current trajectories do not meet the requirement of forming a hyperbolic shape. All critics agree that the drones are flying in straight lines, resulting in an "X" pattern rather than the desired hyperbola. 

While the starting positions of the drones are considered acceptable, the lack of a hyperbolic path significantly impacts the overall score.  

The consensus is that the trajectory planning needs a complete redesign to achieve the desired hyperbolic path.  This involves accurately calculating the hyperbola equation, translating it into waypoint trajectories for each drone, and incorporating collision avoidance mechanisms.

**Based on the feedback:**

* **Previous Score:**  The previous score was not provided.
* **Current Score:** The average score across the critics is around 10/100. 
* **Improvement/Decrease:**  Since we do not have the previous score, we cannot determine if the score has improved or decreased.
