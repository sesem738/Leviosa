 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory based on the prompt:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting formation: The two drones should begin at the two foci of the hyperbola. This ensures they are symmetrically placed and positioned to start tracing their respective branches.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will trace one branch of a hyperbolic path. The branches should be symmetrical about the central axis of the hyperbola. The drones should maintain a constant relative velocity to ensure smoothness of the trajectory. The path should be designed with a smooth transition between the starting position at the foci and the hyperbolic path. 
[REQ] Path parameters: The hyperbola's equation needs to be defined, specifying its eccentricity and the location of its center. These parameters will dictate the exact shape and size of the hyperbola and thus the trajectory of the drones. 
[REQ] Constraints: The trajectory generation should ensure the drones maintain a minimum safe distance from each other to avoid collisions.
