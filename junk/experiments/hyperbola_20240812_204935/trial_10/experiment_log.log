2024-08-12 21:04:27,204 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 2
[REQ] Starting positions: The drones should be positioned symmetrically with respect to the center of the hyperbola, along the transverse axis. 
[REQ] Flight path:
    * Each drone should follow one branch of the hyperbola. 
    * The hyperbola should be symmetrical with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis.
    * The drones should maintain a constant speed along their respective paths to ensure smoothness. 
    * The drones' paths should be continuous and differentiable, ensuring a smooth and predictable trajectory. 
[REQ] Formation: The drones should maintain a symmetrical formation throughout the flight, with each drone following one branch of the hyperbola. 
[REQ] Additional considerations: 
    * The specific parameters of the hyperbola (e.g., focal length, center coordinates) should be defined based on the desired scale and scope of the trajectory. 
    * The drone control system should account for the initial positions and velocities of the drones to ensure a smooth transition into the hyperbolic flight path.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories are not valid. They consistently point out that the drones are not following hyperbolic paths, resulting in straight line trajectories and a non-symmetrical overall formation. While there are no anomalies or collisions, the lack of hyperbolic paths is a major issue. 

The previous score was **0/100**. The current score is **20/100**. This means the score has **improved** by +20. **BETTER**.

The improvement is due to the drones now starting at symmetrical positions along the transverse axis, which is a positive step. However, the lack of hyperbolic paths still prevents the trajectories from meeting the requirements.

Feedback Summary:

The critics agree that the trajectories are still not valid, although there is some improvement from the previous submission. While the drones now seem to follow a continuous path, they are still not forming a hyperbola, which is the primary requirement. 

The starting positions are now considered appropriate by some critics, but others still find issues with symmetry. Concerns remain regarding the drones' speeds and potential collision risks. 

The previous score was **0/100**. The current score is **10/100**. This means the score has **improved** by +10. **BETTER**.

Feedback Summary:

The critics generally agree that the trajectories are still not correct, although there are some improvements from the previous submission. While the drones' paths are now continuous and differentiable, they are still not forming a hyperbola as required. 

There are mixed opinions on the starting positions, with some finding them appropriate while others still see issues with symmetry. The overall shape formed by the drones' trajectories continues to be a major concern, as it does not resemble a hyperbola. 

There are some concerns about the drones' speeds and potential collision risks. 

The previous score was **0/100**. The current score is **20/100**. This means the score has **improved** by +20. **BETTER**.
