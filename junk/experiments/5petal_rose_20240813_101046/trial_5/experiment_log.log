 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 5-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The prompt requests a synchronized flight pattern of 5 drones forming a 5-petal rose curve. This implies a specific formation and movement pattern for the drones to achieve the desired shape.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 5
[REQ] Starting formation: A pentagon with each drone at a vertex, equally spaced and oriented with the center of the pentagon facing the intended direction of the rose curve.
[REQ] Flight path:  
    * Each drone will trace a single petal of the rose curve, starting from its initial pentagon vertex position.
    * The drone's trajectory will be a continuous curve with varying speed and direction to form the petal shape.
    * The curve will have a sinusoidal pattern with a period of 360 degrees (one full rotation).
    * The amplitude of the curve will increase and decrease to create a petal shape with a narrow point at the center and a wider opening at the outside.
    * All drones will move synchronously, with their petals interleaving to form a complete rose curve.
[REQ] Synchronization: All drones must maintain a synchronized movement pattern, with each drone starting and finishing its petal curve at the same time as the others. 
[REQ] Movement control: Each drone will require independent control of its position, speed, and direction to accurately follow its assigned petal trajectory.
[REQ] Communication: A communication system is required to ensure all drones receive synchronized timing and position information, allowing for coordinated movements.
[REQ] Flight height: All drones will maintain a constant height throughout the trajectory.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories are improving but still have room for significant improvements. The most common criticism is that the drones do not fully achieve the desired 5-petal rose curve. 

* **Common strengths:** All critics agree that the drones' paths are continuous and that there are no collisions. The drones also generally start in the correct pentagon formation.
* **Common weaknesses:** The majority of the critiques highlight the lack of a smooth, sinusoidal curve for the petals.  There is also a consistent issue with the petals not being evenly spaced and the drones not starting in a perfectly aligned pentagon.
* **Overall consensus:** The trajectories are getting closer to meeting the requirements but still need significant adjustments to achieve a complete and accurately shaped 5-petal rose curve. 

Based on the provided feedback, the previous score was **30/100**. The current score is **65/100**. 

The score has improved by **+35**. This means the score is **BETTER**.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the critics is that the trajectories are still not meeting the requirements for a 5-petal rose curve. While there are improvements from previous iterations, the overall shape is still not achieved. 

* **Common strengths:** All critics agree that the drones' paths are continuous and that there are no collisions.  The drones also generally start in the correct pentagon formation.
* **Common weaknesses:**  The trajectories are not synchronized, resulting in the petals not being evenly spaced and not forming the correct rose curve shape. There is also an issue with the drones not starting in a perfectly aligned pentagon.  Some critics also point out that the trajectories do not trace a petal-like shape at all, and the shape is more like a star or starfish.
* **Overall consensus:**  While the trajectories are showing some progress, they still need significant adjustments to achieve a complete and accurately shaped 5-petal rose curve. 

Based on the provided feedback, the previous score was **30/100**. The current score is **10/100**.

The score has decreased by **-20**. This means the score is **WORSE**.
