 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 5-Petal Rose Curve

Here are the structured requirements for generating the 5-petal rose curve using 5 drones:

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 5 

**[REQ] Starting formation:** The drones should start in a regular pentagon formation, centered around the desired center point of the rose curve. This ensures a balanced and symmetrical starting point for the curve.

**[REQ] Flight path:** Each drone will fly a petal-shaped trajectory, creating a 5-petal rose curve.  

**[REQ] Path specifics:**

* **Shape:** The trajectory of each drone will resemble a single petal of a rose. This can be achieved by generating a polar curve with the equation r = a sin(nÎ¸), where 'a' is the radius of the rose and 'n' is the number of petals. In this case, n = 5.
* **Synchronization:** The drones' movements must be synchronized to create a harmonious and visually appealing rose shape. Each drone should start its petal trajectory at a slightly different phase of the sine wave, ensuring that the petals are evenly spaced and rotate smoothly.
* **Orientation:** The drones should fly in a counterclockwise direction around the center point of the rose.
* **Completeness:** Each drone should complete a full petal loop. The final position of the drone should be the same as its starting position.

**[REQ] Trajectory planning:**

* The trajectory for each drone should be calculated beforehand and stored within the drone's control system.
* This pre-planned trajectory can then be used to guide the drone's movement, ensuring smooth and synchronized flight.

**[REQ] Communication:**

* The drones should communicate with each other to ensure synchronization.
* This communication can be used to coordinate their starting times, speeds, and phase shifts, ensuring the petals are created harmoniously.

**[REQ] Safety:**

* While this task focuses on the trajectory, real-world applications would require safety considerations such as obstacle avoidance, collision detection, and emergency landing procedures. These are not included in these requirements.
