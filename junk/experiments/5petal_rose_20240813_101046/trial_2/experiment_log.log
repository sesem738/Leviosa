 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 5-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** This prompt describes a choreographed flight pattern where five drones form a symmetrical, multi-petaled rose shape. The drones need to move in a synchronized manner, creating a visually appealing and harmonious pattern.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] Number of drones: 5

[REQ] Starting formation: The five drones should begin in a symmetrical pentagon formation around the center point of the desired rose curve. This ensures an equal distance and distribution for each drone to create a petal.

[REQ] Flight path: Each drone will trace a unique curve that forms one petal of the rose. This curve can be defined using a mathematical equation like a polar equation: 
    * **r = a sin(b*theta)** where:
        * 'r' represents the distance from the center point of the rose 
        * 'theta' represents the angle of rotation
        * 'a' controls the size of the petals 
        * 'b' controls the number of petals (in this case, b = 5)

[REQ] Drone synchronization: The drones must move in a synchronized manner to create a cohesive rose shape. This can be achieved by:
    * **Time-based synchronization:** All drones start at the same time and follow their respective paths with precise timing.
    * **Communication-based synchronization:**  Drones communicate their positions and adjust their speeds to maintain the desired formation.

[REQ] Flight duration: The duration of the flight should be long enough to allow the drones to complete at least one full cycle of the rose curve. This ensures the visual effect of a complete and recognizable rose shape.

[REQ] Flight altitude: The drones should maintain a consistent altitude throughout the flight to create a two-dimensional rose shape. This altitude should be high enough to avoid obstacles and ensure visibility.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Based on the provided feedback, the previous score was **20/100**. The current score is **0/100**. This means the score has **decreased** by **20 points** and is **WORSE**. 

The reason for the decrease is that the provided image only shows one drone trajectory, making it impossible to assess the overall shape, starting positions, and potential collisions. The previous feedback was based on a single trajectory forming a rose shape, but the current feedback highlights the need for multiple drone trajectories.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The provided trajectory plot is still **NOT VALID**. The critics agree that the current feedback is **WORSE** because it shows only one drone's trajectory again, failing to meet the requirement of five drones forming a five-petal rose. This results in a score of **0/100**, a **decrease** of **60 points** from the previous score of **60/100**. 

The main reason for this decrease is the lack of multiple drone trajectories. The critics consistently emphasize the need for all five drones to be present in the plot, following their respective paths to form the complete rose shape.
