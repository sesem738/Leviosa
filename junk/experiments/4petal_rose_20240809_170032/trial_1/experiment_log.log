 ## Requirements for Drone Trajectory Generation: 4-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The prompt requests a synchronized flight path for four drones to collectively create a smooth, continuous 4-petal rose curve. Each drone will trace one petal of the curve.

**Requirements:**

[REQ] **Number of drones:** 4

[REQ] **Starting formation:** Drones should start in a square formation, evenly spaced, with the center of the square coinciding with the origin of the rose curve. 

[REQ] **Flight path:** Each drone will follow a polar coordinate curve defined by the equation r = a * sin(2θ), where 'a' is a constant determining the size of the rose curve. The drones will be assigned different starting angles (θ) to create the 4 petals:

* Drone 1: θ = 0° to 90°
* Drone 2: θ = 90° to 180°
* Drone 3: θ = 180° to 270°
* Drone 4: θ = 270° to 360°

[REQ] **Synchronization:** Drones must maintain a constant relative speed and timing to ensure a smooth and continuous rose curve formation.  

[REQ] **Trajectory Continuity:** At the end of each petal, each drone should smoothly transition to the next petal's starting position. The transition should occur at the origin of the rose curve.  

[REQ] **Flight height:** Drones should maintain a consistent altitude throughout the flight.

[REQ] **Smoothness:** Drones should move with smooth, continuous acceleration and deceleration to avoid abrupt changes in direction.

**Note:** These requirements focus on the trajectory generation, not real-time control or obstacle avoidance.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The consensus is that the trajectories are still not valid, but there's a significant improvement from the previous attempt. The drones are now starting at the correct positions, forming a square formation, which is a major improvement. However, the trajectories themselves still don't quite form the desired 4-petal rose curve. 

The common points of criticism are:

* **Incorrect Trajectory Equation:** The drones are not following the correct `r = a * sin(2θ)` equation, resulting in a shape that resembles a star or a cross instead of a rose curve.
* **Insufficient Smoothness:** While there are no sudden breaks in the paths, the transitions between petals are not smooth enough. The drones should transition smoothly at the origin. 
* **Synchronization Issues:** Some reviewers mention that the drones need to be synchronized in terms of their speed and timing to ensure a smooth and continuous rose curve formation.

The reviewers suggest the following corrections:

* **Implement the Correct Equation:** Make sure each drone follows the `r = a * sin(2θ)` equation throughout its trajectory.
* **Smooth Transitions:** Design a smooth transition between petals by introducing a small, gradual change in the angular speed of each drone as it approaches the end of its current petal.
* **Synchronization:** Implement a mechanism to synchronize the speed and timing of each drone to ensure a smooth and continuous rose curve formation.

**Overall:** The trajectories are showing improvement, but they are still not valid and need further adjustments to meet the requirements. The drones need to follow the correct trajectory equation, synchronize their movements, and ensure smooth transitions between petals.

**Previous Score:** 20/100
**Current Score:** 60/100

**Score Change:** +40 
**Verdict:** BETTER

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The consensus among the reviewers is that the trajectories have improved significantly. While the drones now start in the correct square formation, they are still not following the `r = a * sin(2θ)` equation precisely, resulting in a shape that does not resemble a rose curve. The transitions between petals are still not smooth enough.  

Here's a breakdown of the feedback:

**Common Points of Criticism:**

* **Incorrect Trajectory Equation:**  The drones are not following the correct `r = a * sin(2θ)` equation, resulting in a shape that does not resemble a rose curve.
* **Insufficient Smoothness:** While there are no sudden breaks in the paths, the transitions between petals are not smooth enough. The drones should transition smoothly at the origin. 
* **Synchronization Issues:** Some reviewers mention that the drones need to be synchronized in terms of their speed and timing to ensure a smooth and continuous rose curve formation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Implement the Correct Equation:**  Make sure each drone follows the `r = a * sin(2θ)` equation throughout its trajectory.
* **Smooth Transitions:**  Design a smooth transition between petals by introducing a small, gradual change in the angular speed of each drone as it approaches the end of its current petal.
* **Synchronization:** Implement a mechanism to synchronize the speed and timing of each drone to ensure a smooth and continuous rose curve formation.

**Overall:**

The trajectories are showing improvement, but they are still not valid and need further adjustments to meet the requirements. The drones need to follow the correct trajectory equation, synchronize their movements, and ensure smooth transitions between petals.

**Previous Score:** 0/100
**Current Score:** 20/100

**Score Change:** +20
**Verdict:** BETTER
