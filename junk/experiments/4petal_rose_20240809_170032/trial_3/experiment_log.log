 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 4-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The user wants to create a visual pattern in the sky using four drones, where each drone flies a specific path to form a continuous rose curve with four petals. 

Here are the structured requirements:

[REQ] Number of drones: 4
[REQ] Starting formation: The four drones should start at the center of the intended rose curve, forming a square formation. This ensures a balanced start for each drone's petal trajectory.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone should follow a parametric curve defined by a polar equation, specifically a four-petal rose curve. The equation for this curve is r = a * sin(2*theta), where 'a' is a constant controlling the size of the rose and 'theta' is the angle in radians. Each drone will be responsible for one petal, covering a specific range of theta values:
    - Drone 1: Theta from 0 to pi/2
    - Drone 2: Theta from pi/2 to pi
    - Drone 3: Theta from pi to 3*pi/2
    - Drone 4: Theta from 3*pi/2 to 2*pi

[REQ] Synchronization: The drones must maintain a synchronized flight speed and timing, ensuring smooth transitions between petals and a continuous, visually appealing rose curve. The drones should fly at a constant speed, and each drone should start its petal flight at a calculated time delay based on the theta ranges above.

[REQ] Flight height: The drones should maintain a constant height throughout the trajectory to ensure a clear visual representation of the rose curve. This height should be chosen based on factors like visibility and safety regulations.

[REQ] Flight pattern: The drones should fly in a counter-clockwise direction, starting from the bottom petal and moving upwards, ensuring a consistent direction for the visual effect.
