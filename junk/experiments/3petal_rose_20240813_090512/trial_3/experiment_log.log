2024-08-13 09:12:25,785 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for the 3-petal rose curve drone trajectory:

[REQ] Number of drones: 3 
    * The task explicitly mentions using three drones, each responsible for one petal.

[REQ] Starting formation:  Equilateral triangle centered at the origin of the rose curve.
    * To form a seamless rose pattern, the drones must start in a position where they can begin tracing their petals simultaneously. An equilateral triangle centered at the origin ensures a symmetrical start.

[REQ] Flight path:
    * Each drone will trace a portion of a 3-petal rose curve, specifically one petal.
    * The drones will fly in a synchronized manner, each tracing their respective petal while maintaining a constant distance from the center of the rose. 
    * The three petals should connect seamlessly at their points of intersection to create a complete rose shape.

[REQ] Coordinate system:
    * A 2D Cartesian coordinate system will be used for defining the trajectory.

[REQ] Parametric equations for the rose curve:
    * The drones should follow a parametric equation that defines the rose curve. The equations can vary depending on the desired size and shape of the rose. A common example is:
        * x = a * cos(t) * sin(3t)
        * y = a * sin(t) * sin(3t)
    *  Each drone will be assigned a different phase shift in the 't' parameter to ensure each drone traces a distinct petal. 

[REQ] Synchronization:
    *  A mechanism is required to ensure the drones maintain synchronization during flight. This could be achieved through:
        *  A central control system providing timed commands for each drone.
        *  Direct communication between drones for coordination. 

[REQ] Drone capabilities:
    * The drones should be capable of autonomous flight following a pre-programmed trajectory.
    * They should be equipped with GPS or other positioning systems to ensure accurate navigation.
