 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements: 3-Petal Rose Curve

**Interpretation:** The command requests a synchronized flight pattern of three drones to create a 3-petal rose curve. Each drone should trace one petal seamlessly, implying the drones need to coordinate their movements to ensure a continuous, unbroken pattern.

Here are the structured requirements:

[REQ] Number of drones: 3
[REQ] Starting formation:  The drones should start in a triangular formation, with each drone positioned at the starting point of one petal.
[REQ] Flight path: Each drone should follow a parabolic path to trace out a single petal of the rose curve. The drones should maintain equal speed and timing, ensuring smooth transitions between petals. The starting points of the petals should be equidistant and positioned 120 degrees apart, forming the three points of an equilateral triangle.  The drones should fly in a counter-clockwise direction. 
[REQ] Coordination: The drones must communicate with each other to maintain a synchronized flight path, ensuring that the transition between petals is seamless. Each drone should adjust its speed and path slightly at the petal transitions to ensure a smooth, continuous rose curve.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The reviewers are highly critical of the drone trajectories, finding them to be fundamentally flawed in their attempt to form a 3-petal rose curve. 

**Common Criticisms:**

* **Lack of 3D Movement:**  The drones are primarily moving in 2D planes, failing to create the necessary depth for a rose curve. 
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** The drones are not tracing out complete petals, with some moving in circles or straight lines.
* **Synchronization Issues:** There is a lack of coordination between the drones, resulting in disconnected movements and a failure to create a continuous curve. 
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:** While some reviewers mention the starting positions are correct, others point out that they need to be adjusted to form an equilateral triangle, each drone at the start of a petal.
* **Parabolic Path Needed:**  A parabolic path for each drone is consistently suggested to achieve the correct petal shape.

**Overall Consensus:**

The current trajectories are far from meeting the requirements for a 3-petal rose curve. The reviewers unanimously agree that the drones need to fly in a 3D space, following parabolic paths, and be synchronized to create a continuous and smooth curve.  

**Previous Score:** 60/100

**Current Score:** 0/100

**Score Change:** **WORSE**

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The reviewers are highly critical of the drone trajectories, finding them to be fundamentally flawed in their attempt to form a 3-petal rose curve. 

**Common Criticisms:**

* **Lack of 3 Drones:** The majority of the feedback focuses on the lack of three drones in the image. Only one drone's trajectory is shown, rendering the overall shape incomplete. 
* **Incomplete Trajectories:** Even the single drone shown often fails to complete a full petal, sometimes moving in circles or straight lines instead of a parabolic path.
* **Synchronization Issues:** The reviewers are unable to assess synchronization as there are not enough drones present. 
* **Incorrect Starting Positions:**  While some reviewers note that the single drone's starting position may be correct, there is no information about the starting positions of the missing two drones. 
* **Parabolic Path Needed:** A parabolic path is consistently suggested for each drone to achieve the correct petal shape.

**Overall Consensus:**

The reviewers unanimously agree that the image needs to include the trajectories of three drones, each following a parabolic path and flying in a synchronized manner to achieve the desired 3-petal rose curve. 

**Previous Score:** 60/100

**Current Score:** 0/100
