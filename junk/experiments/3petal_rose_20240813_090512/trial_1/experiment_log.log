2024-08-13 09:05:16,234 - INFO - Interpreted requirements:

 Here are the structured requirements for the drone trajectory based on the provided text prompt:

[REQ] Number of drones: 3
    *  The prompt explicitly states "3 drones", each responsible for a petal.

[REQ] Starting formation: Equilateral triangle centered on the origin of the rose curve.
    * To form a seamless rose pattern, drones must initially be positioned symmetrically around the center point. An equilateral triangle is the most logical starting formation given the 3-petal design.

[REQ] Flight path:
    * Each drone follows a 120° arc segment of a 3-petal rose curve.
        * The rose curve is generated using a polar equation, with each petal requiring a 120° arc segment for a total of 360°.
        * Each drone will trace out one complete petal segment.
    * The drone trajectories must seamlessly connect at the shared endpoints of each petal.
        * This ensures a continuous, unified rose pattern formation.
    * The drones maintain constant relative spacing throughout the flight. 
        * This maintains the equilateral triangle formation while tracing the rose curve.

[REQ] Drone speed: All drones maintain a constant speed.
    *  This ensures a synchronized and coordinated flight pattern for a smooth visual effect.

[REQ] Flight duration:  The flight duration should be long enough for all drones to complete their respective petal segments.
    * This allows the full rose pattern to be visualized.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics generally agree that the trajectories provided are not valid. The drones do not follow the required paths to form the desired 3-petal rose curve. While some aspects are correct, such as the continuous paths and the lack of collisions, the major issues are:

* **Incomplete trajectories:** Drones do not complete the full 120° arc segments required to form the petals.
* **Incorrect starting positions:**  The drones' initial positions do not form a centered equilateral triangle, significantly affecting the overall shape.
* **Lack of a cohesive rose pattern:**  The individual trajectories do not combine seamlessly to form a visually appealing and accurate rose pattern.

The critics highlight the need for adjustments to the starting positions, trajectory control, and overall path planning to achieve the desired outcome.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics generally agree that the trajectories provided are not valid. Although there are some improvements from the previous attempt, the drones still do not follow the required paths to form the desired 3-petal rose curve. While some aspects are correct, such as the continuous paths and the lack of collisions, the major issues are:

* **Incomplete trajectories:** Drones do not complete the full 120° arc segments required to form the petals.
* **Incorrect starting positions:** The drones' initial positions still do not form a centered equilateral triangle, significantly affecting the overall shape.
* **Lack of a cohesive rose pattern:** The individual trajectories do not combine seamlessly to form a visually appealing and accurate rose pattern.

The critics highlight the need for adjustments to the starting positions, trajectory control, and overall path planning to achieve the desired outcome. They suggest re-calculating the trajectories using the correct rose curve equation and ensuring drones maintain constant relative spacing to preserve the equilateral triangle formation throughout the flight.
