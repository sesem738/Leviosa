 ## Requirements for Sine Wave Drone Formation:

[REQ] Number of drones: 3
[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should be positioned at the peaks of the sine wave, evenly spaced along the x-axis.  
[REQ] Flight path:  Each drone will fly a segment of the sine wave, ensuring continuity. 
    * Drone 1: Flies the leftmost section of the sine wave, starting at the peak and descending to the trough, then ascending to the peak again.
    * Drone 2: Flies the middle section of the sine wave, starting at the peak, descending to the trough, then ascending to the peak.
    * Drone 3: Flies the rightmost section of the sine wave, starting at the peak, descending to the trough, then ascending to the peak.
[REQ] Coordination: The drones must maintain a constant horizontal distance between them to preserve the shape of the wave.
[REQ] Velocity:  Each drone should maintain a consistent velocity throughout its trajectory to ensure a smooth wave formation. 
[REQ] Synchronization: The drones' movements should be synchronized to avoid collisions and maintain the integrity of the wave. 
[REQ] Altitude:  Drones should maintain a consistent altitude throughout the trajectory.
[REQ] Wave parameters: Define the amplitude, frequency, and wavelength of the sine wave to dictate the overall shape and size of the formation.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics consistently highlight the issue of the drones not forming a proper sine wave.  They point out that the drones are either flying in a straight line, or forming individual sine waves instead of a single, synchronized formation.

There is a general agreement that the starting positions of the drones need to be adjusted to ensure they are at the peaks of the sine wave. The starting positions are inconsistent in many of the submissions, leading to an inaccurate formation. 

The overall consensus is that the trajectories need significant revisions. The drones need to be programmed to fly a single continuous sine wave, maintaining a constant horizontal distance between each other. 

The critics also emphasize the importance of consistent altitude throughout the trajectories.

 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics are generally in agreement that the trajectories are not valid, as they do not form a complete and synchronized sine wave. They point out that the drones' paths are incomplete, often stopping before reaching a peak, and do not properly overlap to create a continuous wave. While some critics acknowledge that the drones start at the correct positions and have no apparent collisions, the majority agree that the trajectories need substantial revision.

There is also concern regarding the synchronization of the drones, with some critics noting that the drones are not moving at a consistent speed, leading to a chaotic and uneven formation.  

The overall consensus is that the drones need to be programmed to fly a single, continuous sine wave with each drone covering a section of the wave and maintaining a consistent horizontal distance from each other. They also emphasize the importance of extending the trajectories to complete a full cycle of the sine wave, ensuring that each drone reaches a peak.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
Feedback Summary:

The critics are largely in agreement that the drones' trajectories are not valid, primarily due to their failure to form a complete and synchronized sine wave. The common issues identified include:

* **Incomplete trajectories:** The drones often fail to complete a full cycle of the sine wave, stopping before reaching a peak or deviating from the expected path.
* **Lack of synchronization:** The drones' movements are not coordinated, leading to uneven spacing and potentially hazardous collisions.
* **Incorrect overall shape:** The drones' paths do not effectively combine to create a recognizable sine wave formation. 

While some critics acknowledge that the drones start in appropriate positions and there are no obvious collisions, the overall consensus is that the trajectories need substantial revision.

**Score Summary:**

The previous score was **20/100**.

The current score is **30/100**.

The score has improved by **+10**. **BETTER**

Feedback Summary:

The critics agree that the drones' trajectories are getting closer to meeting the requirements, but they still have significant issues. 

Here are the common points:

* **Improved Continuity:**  While not all drones are complete, the trajectories are generally continuous.
* **Incomplete Trajectories:**  Multiple drones still fail to complete a full sine wave cycle, especially Drone 3.
* **Lack of Synchronization:**  The drones still need to be synchronized to form a proper sine wave, especially concerning Drone 3's straight line segment which poses a collision risk.
* **Overall Shape:** The overall formation still doesn't form a recognizable sine wave. 

Despite the improvements, the consensus is that the trajectories still require significant adjustments.

**Score Summary:**

The previous score was **20/100**.

The current score is **55/100**.

The score has improved by **+35**. **BETTER**

Feedback Summary:

The critics are in agreement that the trajectories have improved, but are still not fully meeting the requirements. 

Here are the common points:

* **Improved Continuity:** The trajectories are generally continuous, with most drones successfully navigating their segments.
* **Incomplete Trajectories:**  Several drones fail to complete the full sine wave cycle, particularly Drone 3 which shows a straight line segment.
* **Lack of Synchronization:**  Synchronization between the drones remains an issue, with Drone 3's straight line segment creating a collision risk.
* **Overall Shape:** The overall formation still does not form a clear sine wave, with Drone 3's straight line segment being a major contributing factor. 

Despite the progress, the consensus is that significant adjustments are still needed for the trajectories to meet the requirements.
