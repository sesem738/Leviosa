 ## Requirements for Sine Wave Drone Formation:

[REQ] Number of drones: 3

[REQ] Starting formation: The drones should be positioned at the starting points of their respective wave segments, ensuring a smooth transition between them. To achieve this, they should be aligned along the x-axis, with equal spacing between them, and with the middle drone at the peak of its segment.  

[REQ] Flight path: 
    - Each drone should follow a sinusoidal path along the y-axis, with its amplitude and wavelength determined by the desired shape and size of the wave.
    - The drones should maintain their relative positions on the wave, ensuring a continuous and smooth formation.
    - The middle drone should fly the central portion of the wave, while the outer drones fly the left and right sections. 
    - All drones should start and end their flight path at the same time, maintaining their respective positions on the wave. 
    - The drone trajectories should be synchronized to create a smooth wave motion, avoiding any abrupt changes in direction or speed.

[REQ] Synchronization: The drones must be synchronized to maintain their positions and flight paths. The system should ensure smooth transitions between drone segments and prevent any interruptions or gaps in the wave formation. 

[REQ] Safety:  While not explicitly stated, the drones should maintain a safe distance from each other to avoid collisions.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback indicates a general consensus that the drone trajectories are not meeting the requirements, specifically regarding the formation of a smooth sine wave, the synchronization of the drones, and their positioning. 

The scores provided by the critics range from 0 to 65, with most critics scoring below 50.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Critic 1:** Score of 30/100. 
* **Critic 2:** Score of 0/100.
* **Critic 3:** Score of 20/100.
* **Critic 4:** Score of 65/100.
* **Critic 5:** Score of 40/100.

**Overall, the previous score was likely around 35/100 (average of the scores).** 

You haven't provided the current score, so I cannot determine whether it has improved or worsened.  To determine if the score has improved or worsened, please provide the current score.
