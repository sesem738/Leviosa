 ## Drone Trajectory Requirements for a 3-Petal Rose Curve

**Intent:** Generate a 3-petal rose curve using 3 drones, with each drone tracing out a single petal. The drones should coordinate to achieve a seamless and continuous rose shape.

**Requirements:**

**[REQ] Number of drones:** 3 

**[REQ] Starting formation:** The 3 drones should start at the center point of the intended rose curve, forming an equilateral triangle with sides equal to the desired petal radius.

**[REQ] Flight path:** Each drone should follow a parametric equation that generates a single petal of the rose curve. The drones' trajectories should be synchronized so that the individual petals are drawn simultaneously, resulting in a continuous and seamless 3-petal rose. 

**[REQ]  Synchronization:** A system to ensure the drones maintain a consistent speed and follow their paths simultaneously is necessary. This can be achieved through a shared clock or central control system that provides timed waypoints to each drone. 

**[REQ]  Path Continuity:** The trajectory equations for each drone should be chosen so that the end point of one petal seamlessly connects to the start point of the next petal, creating a visually smooth and continuous rose shape. 

**[REQ]  Rose Curve Parameters:** Define the desired size and orientation of the rose curve. This will involve specifying the petal radius, petal width, and the angle of rotation of the entire rose pattern.  

**[REQ]  Flight Speed:** Specify a consistent flight speed for all drones. This will determine the overall duration of the rose pattern formation.

 MAJORITY INVALID (0/5)
 Feedback Summary:
The feedback indicates a consistent problem: the drones are not forming a 3-petal rose curve. While the starting positions and continuity of individual paths are generally good, the drones are instead creating circles or incomplete arcs. 

The previous score was **30/100**. The current score is **10/100**. Therefore, the score has **WORSE** by 20 points.

The main issues are:

* **Incorrect trajectory equations:** The drones are not following the correct parametric equations to generate a 3-petal rose.
* **Lack of synchronization:** The drones are not moving in a coordinated manner to create a continuous rose shape. The petals are not drawn simultaneously, leading to a disjointed final shape.
* **Incomplete petals:** The drones are only tracing out a portion of each petal, instead of the full curve. 

The critics consistently suggest using the correct parametric equations for a 3-petal rose curve and implementing a synchronization system to ensure the drones move in a coordinated manner. They also emphasize the need for complete petals by ensuring each drone traces out the full curve, and the end point of one drone's path seamlessly connects to the starting point of the next.
